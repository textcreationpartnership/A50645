            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Readers.</head>
            <p>YOu are inform'd at the beginning of the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe what Accident engag'd me in it. And ſince (as you will perceive) it was not Choice but Neceſſity, I have a Title to your favorable peruſal. When perſons offer themſelves at the Bar for the Defence of Others, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they ſhould be Eloquent <hi>(that is)</hi> qualified for ſuch an Undertaking: but when a man is brought thither to plead for himſelf, it is enough if he come with Sincerity, and an intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>Again, if outward Objects have ſo much influence on the Conceptions of the Mind, as they are believ'd to have on thoſe of the Body, you will not look for great matters in this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, when you conſider not only my own Inability, but alſo what lay before my eyes whil'ſt I compos'd it: For certainly whatever Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> may have ſhewn himſelf in other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, theſe which have been the Subject of my <hi>Remarks</hi> do not challenge our admiration for their <hi>Excellence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Method,</hi> I take that which is uſual in <hi>Remarks,</hi> by ſuffering my Author to lead me which way he pleaſes, and therefore whatever leaps I am forc'd to make from one Matter to another, muſt be attributed to thoſe <hi>Hedges</hi> and <hi>Ditches</hi> ouer which I am conducted by him. But to ſay the Truth, how unpleaſant ſoever theſe Incoherences may appear to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they were of no ſmall Convenience to me: For having no
<pb facs="tcp:41662:3"/>
time for this Task, but what was greatly interrupted both by <hi>Buſineſs</hi> and <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> my Memory would hardly have ſerv'd me to have carried the Matter of any large and connected Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe through ſo many Intermiſſions, and ſuch variety of other thoughts, whereas this broken and incoherent Theme was (as it happen'd) very ſuitable to my leiſure.</p>
            <p>However, theſe Interruptions muſt apologize for that ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wherewith this Pamphlet comes abroad; For tho' much time be paſt ſince Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi>'s Books call'd on me (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the former) yet that which has been at my diſpoſal has not been much. Nay, on the contrary, it has been ſo little, that what comes forth with ſo much ſeeming deliberation, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally written in more haſt than my Forces (which have not been much exercis'd this way) could well comply with. And indeed had I not conſider'd that things of this nature grow out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon like <hi>Gazetts</hi> and <hi>Almanacs,</hi> I ſhould have had ſo much reſpect for my Readers, as to have ſpent a few more hours in preparing for their Entertainment.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, whether it be to manifeſt the quickneſs of his Parts, or to ſhew us that his Pariſhioners are ſo <note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners.</note> 
               <hi>pious,</hi> and ſo <hi>* ſteddy,</hi> that they need not the looking after, is very fruitful in ſuch Productions; but <hi>Nobis non licet eſſe tàm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But altho' in the Method of this Diſcourſe (as I have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated) I follow my Author, yet I do it not ſo cloſely, but that ſometimes I make a ſtand, and take a view of ſuch things as lie within proſpect. My thoughts have not been ſo wholly
<pb facs="tcp:41662:3"/>
buſied in vindicating my ſelf (as I have had occaſion to take notice of in ſome places of the following Paper) much leſs in annoying my Adverſary, that I have not conſider'd which way to benefit my Readers: And herein if I have treated of ſome things which may ſeem beneath the Dignity of the Preſs, (for I have attended in my choice more to ordinary Converſations than to Books) I hope it may paſs without Cenſure. For ſince all higher Points are already ſufficiently diſcuſs'd by Learned Pens, I am not to be blamed if I chooſe ſome of thoſe which are not only more proportionable to my ſtrength, but alſo may be taken up with leſs Preſumption, for having been rejected by better Writers as not worth their while.</p>
            <p>And yet, had theſe matters which I here ſpeak of been only the peculiar Extravagances of ſome over-ſtrain'd Fancy, they might, and ought perhaps to have been contemn'd: But when ſuch trivial things (if you will call them ſo) are daily both ſpoken with Confidence, and heard with Patience; nay, when oftentimes (at leaſt in outward ſhew) they are the ſole hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Converſion, they ceaſe to be <hi>trivial;</hi> and we muſt recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that <hi>Idea,</hi> which we have of them from the bare conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Nature, by weighing their Effects. A Chirurgeon is not ſo much to attend to the prick of a Thorn, as to the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene which poſſibly may have been cauſed by it.</p>
            <p>And now I will not deny but it is the greateſt of my Deſires that all my Proteſtant Readers might be Converted. They will not take this in ill part, when they know I firmly believe there is not other way for their <hi>Salvation.</hi> However, what I ask of them at preſent is much <hi>leſs,</hi> and even what themſelves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:41662:4"/>
refuſe, without pleaſing me much better, <hi>viz.</hi> by changing their Religion. This will be no longer a Paradox, when I tell them, It is only that (for ſome time at leaſt) they would be <hi>truly</hi> Proteſtants: My meaning is, That whereas they affirm, <hi>firſt,</hi> that their Faith is not to be pinn'd on another's Sleeve; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that none ought to pretend to Infallibility, they would now conform themſelves to their own Principles, and conſequently neither be ſo far enchanted by the Name or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of their Teachers on the one ſide, as to take things from them without farther Examination, nor ſo far ty'd to their own Opinions on the other, as not to ſuſpect them where they are contradicted by Men as Wiſe, as Learned, and (as far as may be gueſs'd by the exterior) as Good as themſelves. This, I ſay, is all I ask of my Proteſtant Readers; and this (as I hinted) is nothing elſe in effect than <hi>that they would be Proteſtants.</hi> The Reformation it ſelf was grounded on the firſt of theſe two Principles, and the ſecond is a Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from the firſt: For how could Chriſtians have ſeparated from their Church-Guides in order to a Reformation, had they not fancied an Obligation of <hi>Diſtruſting</hi> them? And having once (for the neceſſary juſtification of this Proceeding) denied <hi>Infallibility</hi> to theſe Guides, with what ſhadow of Modeſty could they arrogate the ſame to themſelves?</p>
            <p>Nothing therefore is ſo primarily Eſſential to Proteſtants, as to conclude both Themſelves and their Leaders <hi>Fallible,</hi> and in conſequence of this to <hi>Diſtruſt</hi> both. And from hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows (according to what I intimated before) that when they do otherwiſe <hi>(that is,</hi> abſolutely confide in either) their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy</hi> is at an end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41662:4"/>
This in Truth is conſonant to Reaſon, and therefore one would think that what I here ask were already granted. But alas! Reaſon was never more Pretended, nor leſs Uſed; and theſe Gentlemen are ſo far from having it in our preſent Caſe, that one Part of them, whil'ſt they decry all dependence on <hi>Men</hi> for their Faith with the greateſt impatience, repoſe ſo entirely on This, or the Other <hi>Reverend Doctor,</hi> or on Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them together, that altho' theſe very Doctors <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>By a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence from their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Church is to be follow'd no farther than it agrees with Scripture, and each man is left to judge how far ſhe ſo agrees.</hi>
               </note> teach them the contrary, they are ready to <hi>believe</hi> them in every thing but this; and the Reſt wondring at General Councils for <hi>pretending to Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> talk in the mean while themſelves with ſo much Authority, and ſo little Diffidence, as if they ſpoke by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Inſpiration from Heaven.</p>
            <p>This is what truly paſſes in the World; but this is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what ought not to paſs: For whatever Allowances may be made to Ignorance where men proceed <hi>according to the beſt of their Knowledge,</hi> there is certainly no excuſe for Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, whil'ſt they declare that both their Teachers and their own Judgments are liable to Error in Doctrins of Faith, if nevertheleſs they ſuffer themſelves to be deceiv'd by either.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> I hope you will not <hi>ſay</hi> you may be miſtaken, and yet <hi>act</hi> as if you could not; but that, reflecting on the Uncertainty which even your own Principles ſhew you to be in, you will do what ſo much danger naturally ſuggeſts, <hi>viz.</hi> have recourſe to Almighty God, who is our
<pb facs="tcp:41662:5"/>
only Refuge in all Diſtreſſes, <hi>earneſtly</hi> and <hi>conſtantly</hi> beſeeching him, that ſince you cannot pleaſe him without Faith, nor have Faith whil'ſt you have Doubt, he would bring you to ſuch a Faith as may <hi>rationally</hi> exclude all Doubting, and ſo yield you a ſolid Foundation for both your Hope and Charity.</p>
            <p>This Reſolution of addreſſing your ſelves to God by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prayer is of ſo great moment, that tho' I could heartily wiſh that <hi>this</hi> were now your Preparation of mind for the reading of this Pamphlet, yet I ſhould be very well content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if it ſhould prove the fruit of your Peruſal, and that when you made an end of <hi>Reading,</hi> you would be throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the neceſſity of <hi>Praying.</hi> And it is for this reaſon that I make the ſame Requeſt to you once more in my <hi>Cloſe.</hi> And certainly I may well deſpair of obtaining any other favor from you, if after all my Entreaties you deny me What your own Teachers, your own Principles, and your own greateſt Intereſt asks of you as well as my ſelf.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are few perſons (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) but ſuch as have a great conceit of themſelves, who are willing, that all the words which drop from them in the heat of a tumultuous and unprepared Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſhould be Publiſhed through the preſent Age, or recommended to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; <hi>at leaſt,</hi> in no better dreſs, than the haſt they were ſpoken in would allow. But when ſuch caſual expreſſions, are not only diveſted of their Antecedent and Conſequent Circumſtances, but muſt bear the Additions and Defalcations of Craft and Malice over and above; nay, when a <hi>Diſputing</hi> Adverſary, not only takes care to Interrupt his Opponents Diſcourſe, and by that means renders his Propoſitions maim'd and imperfect; but alſo, when he has them at home, mangles them yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41662:6"/>
and in this plight (like a deform'd <hi>Sampſon)</hi> expoſes them to mockery; the injury is too great to need any other aggravation, than barely the being told. However, this Injuſtice is heighten'd, when to make theſe miſhapen Sentences of his Antagoniſt appear yet more ugly, his own are trimm'd up and placed by them with a far better Air in Print, than that which they had at the Conference.</p>
               <p>And yet how provoking ſoever this injury may be, I call God to witneſs, that my own Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (tho' it ſuffer as far as either Dr. <hi>Teniſons</hi> Tongue, or Pen is a Slander) ſhould never have prevailed with me to have appeared in its Defence: Since (over and above the Repugnance I ſtill have to this kind of coming upon the Stage) it ought to be a greater comfort to a Chriſtian to bear an Affront with patience, than to enſure the Praiſe of the whole World. And thoſe who have been the moſt acquainted with the exerciſes of a vertuous life, have always aſſerted, that Applauſe in this warfare is much an harder Enemy to deal with, than Calumny. It is not my Reputation then (any farther than the preſervation of it is a Duty) which calls upon me at this time to take the Pen into my hand: But it is that which ſeems to be ſo united to it, as to ſuffer with it, I mean my Religion. For altho' perſonal defects (unleſs they come to be general) ought to caſt no blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh on any Profeſſion, yet how far ſhall we think that ſuch things will influence weak perſons, when a <note n="*" place="margin">Gubbard <hi>whom D.</hi> T. <hi>(in his Ep. to his Pariſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) mentions to have ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Father in his Benefice of</hi> Mondeſly, <hi>and afterwards to have Preached Purgatory,</hi> &amp;c: <hi>might (for ought the Doctor pretends to know) during his ſtay in that place come firſt to be convinced of the truth of ſuch points as he Preached, ſo that what the Doctor takes for</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation <hi>(which probably would not have diſcovered it ſelf where there was a good Benefice to be loſt by it) might be</hi> Change. <hi>It being great pity, that every one ſhould be as</hi> Immutable <hi>in</hi> Evil <hi>as D.</hi> T. <hi>This might be the caſe, or elſe this</hi> G<hi>— might be a Church of England-man as others have obſerved.</hi>

                  <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> Crime of a <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> Jeſuit made ſo violent an Impreſſion on Dr. <hi>Teniſon,</hi> whilſt he was Young, againſt their whole Order, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41662:6"/>
(maugre his entire Doctorſhip of Divinity) he is like to carry it with him to his Grave: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to the Tribunal of that Judge, who, when he was our Maſter, taught us more Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Leſſons? And to ſuch a ſtrange degree of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality does this raſh Judgment arrive, that with many Proteſtants one good Man is ſufficient to bring their Religion into Repute, and one evil Chriſtian enough to Diſcredit ours. Which, tho' unreaſonable in them, is yet a good Argument to us; in the firſt place, that we ſhould take the utmoſt care, not to afford any juſt ground for Aſperſions; and in the next, that we ſhould endeavor (as far as modeſty gives leave) to reſcue our ſelves from thoſe, which are unjuſtly thrown upon us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' I am not ignorant how hard a thing it is for the plaineſt reaſon to break through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of prepoſſeſſed and embittered minds; yet becauſe I hope there are ſtill ſome impartial (at leaſt not extravagantly partial) Men in the World, I will not decline this task, which I ſhall look on as ſufficiently recompenſed, if it ſhall help to bring any one Soul from under thoſe miſtakes which Dr. <hi>Teniſons leſs ſincere and leſs Generous</hi>

               <p>Dr. <hi>T.</hi> is not ſo ill a Painter, as not to know, that a few ſtrokes of the Pencil, will quite change the Countenance of the Picture, nor (as we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by his Narrative) ſo diſintereſted, as not to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41662:7"/>
make uſe of this knowledge, when it is for his advantage.</p>
               <p>However, that we may not make our Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him more difficult than is needful, there is one part of that Miſrepreſentation which I noted above, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſuppoſititious Ornaments of his own ſayings, for which we ſhall not lay much to his charge; for, altho' his part of the Conference hath been lick'd ſince it's Birth into as much ſhape as it was capable of, yet after all this paternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry it is but an homely Creature ſtill, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth us much harm, nor (I am verily perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) would it have appeared to the Doctor himſelf worthy of Publication, had it not been in vertue of that Inſtinct, whereby <hi>The Crow thinks her own Young ones the whiteſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>P.</hi> was the chief (and indeed, the only perſon Originally concerned) in this Conference, and, as ſuch, he hath given the World a juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it. What relates to my ſelf, is much ſhorter and of leſs moment, for tho' a vein of my Name runs through the Doctors whole Narrative, which makes people think, that I was a principal Combatant in this occaſion; yet in truth, coming only as a witneſs, and under an obligation of ſilence, I Religiouſly obſerved it, unleſs it were, when the Doctor applied his Diſcourſe to me: And then too I ſpoke no longer than the Doctor pleaſed, which was not half ſo long, as was neceſſary for the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, or even propoſing any one Argument. Which I could not take ill for two Reaſons; Firſt, <hi>becauſe I was not his proper Antagoniſt;</hi> And Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>becauſe he uſed him that was ſo, after the ſame</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41662:7"/>
                  <hi>faſhion.</hi> I ſay, I never meddled in the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, but when the Doctor ſpoke to me, and it would have been <hi>ill breeding</hi> not to have anſwered him<hi>:</hi> Excepting only, at the latter end of the day, when the Diſputants roſe up, and there ſeemed to be <hi>a Liberty of Conſcience</hi> for ſpeaking; eſpecially when the Doctor blurted out a Propoſition, which all good Men, who ſhould have reflected on it's conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, ought to have taken notice of.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I was ſeparated from them for a very conſiderable time: <hi>viz.</hi> (as I believe) during the greateſt part of the Conference. For Mr. <hi>P.</hi> having intreated me not to meddle with the Diſputation, and a Catholic Gentlewoman, or two obſerving, that Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> when he had no deſire to anſwer Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s. Queſtions, would turn abruptly towards me, and as ſoon as he had a mind to break off with me (which as I have ſaid already, was very ſoon) he turned as abruptly back again to Mr. <hi>P.</hi> They adviſed me to withdraw; one of them telling me; that the Doctor by the opportunity he had of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and fro in that manner, not only evaded the proſecution of the Arguments, but had alſo a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pretence of boaſting (as he did) that he had two to deal with. Whereupon I thanked them for their advice, and not greatly apprehending the loſs, I was like to ſuſtain by being abſent from the Diſcourſe, I retired into another corner of the Room; where (according to what I have ſaid) I contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a great while, talking with ſeveral perſons (all Strangers to me) and not knowing what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between the Diſputants; for tho' ſoon after my going off, Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> (having ſome occaſion, as I ſuppoſe, for diverting the Diſcourſe) called
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41662:8"/>
for me back; yet I excuſed my ſelf, telling him, that he had excepted againſt my Company at firſt, and that therefore I might venture on ſo much ill breeding, as to refuſe it to him now, or to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Neither did I return to him, till his clamor and his parties importunity even forced me to it, which (as I take it) was not very long before the Conference broke up. And then too as ſoon as the Doctor ſhook me off by turning again to Mr. <hi>P.</hi> I retired as before.</p>
               <p>I mention this, that my Readers may have a true notion of that part which I bore in this Conference, and not be miſguided by the Doctors Relation, which ſcarce allows me any interval of abſence, and ſeems to make me privy to Diſcourſes, which I knew nothing of, and therefore can ſay nothing to. And whoſoever conſiders what I have here related of my own concern in this Diſpute, and how little even Dr. <hi>T.</hi> himſelf ſays of any body elſe, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only Mr. <hi>P,</hi> will not judge that the Doctor, tho' he ſpeaks of nine Prieſts or Prieſts fellows, was overmatch'd by number.</p>
               <p>Moreover had Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſtood in need of the Doctors Craft, and applied himſelf to the ſtanders by, the might have had the Credit and Convenience of (at leaſt) Twenty Antagoniſts. And even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his ſeeking he had two or three beſides the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter: Particularly the School-maſter, whom I look upon as next to a Miniſter, with as much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (I preſume) as the Doctor look'd on me as next to a Prieſt. Beſides, for the Doctors farther encouragement, the <hi>Cry</hi> was on his ſide: <hi>To hear him ſpeak, not to interrupt him</hi> (that is, <hi>to ſuffer him to interrupt you)</hi> and the like, which are of no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41662:8"/>
ſmall advantage in ſuch engagements, where to ſpeak moſt, is to argue beſt.</p>
               <p>But not to detain my Readers any longer from a more particular and methodical account (as far as ſo much confuſion will allow of method) of what concerned me in this wonderful buſineſs, I muſt acquaint them, that on <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> day laſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been at the <hi>Savoy</hi> Chappel, to comply with the Obligations of that Feſtival; at my going thence, I met with Mr. <hi>P.</hi> who told me, <hi>That at three of the Clock in the Afternoon he was to have a Conference with Dr.</hi> Teniſon; <hi>That it had been occaſioned by an Apprentice, who had come to him, to be inſtructed in the Catholic Religion, and thereby greatly diſpleaſed his Friends, and particularly his Maſter. That it was thought convenient, he ſhould not go alone, but take ſome perſon with him who might obſerve what paſſed, and hinder, as much as might be, the bad effects of ſuch Miſrepreſentations, as experience ſhews us, are hardly avoidable on theſe occaſions. That he deſired, that I would be the perſon, who accompanied him. Laſtly, That it would not be my Province to ſpeak any thing, but only</hi> (as he had ſaid) <hi>to take notice of what paſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, my willingneſs to be engaged in this affair was not extraordinary. It had not been very long, ſince I had drawn a ſufficient trouble on my ſelf by hearkening to ſuch another Invitation, and had learnt at the expence of loſing that Privacy which I would have preſerv'd, how unſafe it is to ſhare (tho' never ſo inconſiderably,) in a <hi>Difference</hi> with Men, who poſſibly may have better Wits than Conſciences, and care not how they wound the latter, ſo they may ſecure the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the former. However, conſidering
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41662:9"/>
that we were not born for our ſelves, and that our reward hereafter, will be proportionable to our labors here; I reſolved to comply with Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and leave the event to Providence, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes all things for the beſt, and will not ſuffer us to be <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> tryed beyond that which we are able to bear-Wherefore I told Mr. <hi>P. that I was to Dine at an Houſe in</hi> Spring-Garden, <hi>near</hi> Charing-Croſs, <hi>and that if he pleaſed to call on me there, at two of the Clock, I would wait on him to the place appointed for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> which (as he had told me) was in <hi>Long-Acre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>P.</hi> came to me at the prefixt hour, having no body in his Company, as ſeveral worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can witneſs, and I (likewiſe alone) immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately departed with him.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we were on our way, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> told me, <hi>that he intended to propoſe a</hi> Rule of Faith <hi>for the Subject of the Conference:</hi> Which I very much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, as being that, whereon (according to my judgment) the whole buſineſs of Controverſie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; for, ſince all ſides agree, that there are ſome things neceſſary to be Believed in order to Salvation, and hence it is rationally inferred, that Almighty God muſt have left ſome means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the knowledge of ſuch <hi>neceſſary</hi> things<hi>:</hi> Which <hi>means</hi> we call the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> It follows, that when we have the Rule of Faith, we have the means of knowing what we are bound to believe, and what not; which is the end of all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</p>
               <p>And therefore I wonder, that Dr. <hi>T.</hi> ſhould ſo often ſay, <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 13. 17, 21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that he deſired to fix Mr.</hi> P. <hi>to ſomething in his Diſputation, that he could keep him to nothing,</hi> and the like. As if he had propoſed nothing for the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41662:9"/>
matter of their Debate, when he propoſed <hi>a Rule of Faith;</hi> whereas it is the main, or indeed the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing which ought to be well ſettled. For par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Articles of Faith may be True according to one Rule, and Falſe according to another, and therefore unleſs we know what Rule is true, we ſhall not be able to diſtinguiſh what Articles are true. As for inſtance, the Quakers Article of the <hi>unlawfulneſs of all manner of Swearing</hi> is true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule of <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Swear not, neither by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, neither by Earth, neither by any other Oath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>St.</hi> James <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Scripture interpreted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> but falſe according to the Rule of <hi>Scripture interpreted by the Tradition of the Church,</hi> and there will be no means of telling the Quakers, which Doctrin they ought to believe, unleſs you can tell them, which of the two Rules they ought to follow.</p>
               <p>I hope, the Reader will pardon this Digreſſion, for the great importance of the matter, and when he hath well conſidered it, will not be of Dr. <hi>T</hi>'s. mind, and think the adjuſting, or aſcertaining a Rule of Faith, to be ſo trivial a thing, nay, to be nothing, as the Doctor makes it. But becauſe I believe, that I ſhall have occaſion of ſaying more on this ſubject hereafter, I will ſay no more at preſent.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>P.</hi> having (as I ſaid) acquainted me with the Queſtion he had choſen out for the ſubject of the Conference, I told him, <hi>That having had ſome experience of ſuch meetings, I foreſaw that all would end in confuſion, unleſs what was ſpoken on both ſides by way of Argument, were immediately Written down.</hi> And therefore I adviſed him to propoſe as ſoon as we met, <hi>that it might be ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being come to <hi>Long-Acre,</hi> we went into an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41662:10"/>
Houſe, which was not far from that where the Conference was to be, and ſtayed there till news was brought us, that Dr. <hi>T.</hi> was come.</p>
               <p>During our ſtay in this Houſe, there came in a Gentleman to us, whom I had never ſeen before: Nor (as I underſtood afterwards) was he ſo much as known by name to Mr. <hi>P.</hi> He looked, as if his Curioſity, or ſome better Motive led him, to know what ſhould happen at the Conference. We were told alſo, <hi>that it had been noiſed abroad, and that there would be many Proteſtants at it.</hi> For my part I thought, that the more perſons were preſent, the more good would probably be done, in caſe the Conference were fairly carried on, and eſpecially by <hi>Writing.</hi> I had never heard that it was agreed on, that the Meeting ſhould be private, nor cared that it ſhould be ſo. For, <hi>Veritas non quaerit Angulos,</hi> and the Catholic Faith was never yet affraid of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, but always of being Hidden, that is, by Lies, Slanders and other Miſrepreſentations kept from the Peoples knowledge.</p>
               <p>Word being brought, <hi>that the Doctor was come,</hi> we <hi>(viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and my ſelf) went immediately to him. Who followed us, I neither knew, nor troubled my ſelf to obſerve; having always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that there were but two concerned, Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> as the Controvertiſt, and my ſelf only as a witneſs<hi>:</hi> And that the reſt (whether Proteſtants or Catholics) came only as Hearers.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as we entred into the Room, where Dr. <hi>T.</hi> was, the Doctor Greeted us with a Cavil, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat to this purpoſe<hi>: Look you here, I am come without ſo much as a Friend or Servant: This (viz.</hi> The coming in of ſo much Company) <hi>is not</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41662:10"/>
                  <hi>according to our agreement.</hi> M. <hi>P.</hi> replyed to this effect, <hi>That he had only brought one Gentleman with him,</hi> viz. <hi>Me: That I was not to ſpeak at all in the Controverſie, but only came as a witneſs of what paſſed: That he thought this caution reaſonable in regard of the many Miſrepreſentations, which had been but too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of late in things of this Nature.</hi> Hereupon the Doctor addreſſed himſelf to me, and asked me (in a Tone more imperious than I have uſually met with) <hi>whether I was a Prieſt or not:</hi> Saying, that <hi>now</hi> (to his grief, I ſuppoſe) <hi>I need not be affraid to own it.</hi> I anſwered him, (tho' I <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 15.</note>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41662:11"/>
do now my Readers) to what I had <note n="*" place="margin">A Letter to Dr. <hi>E. S, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Publiſhed in this matter. In which the whole matter of Fact is repreſented with ſo much fairneſs, that notwithſtanding what a ſubtile and concern'd Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary has been able to alledge againſt it, I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not, but it ſtill remains moſt ſatisfactory with all thoſe, whoſe prejudices ſtand not more in need of Grace for their removal, than Arguments. And for this reaſon, being informed, that the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſial part of this affair was undertaken by bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hands (a task in which, there is nothing labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſave only the great copiouſneſs of that which eaſily offers it ſelf to be ſpoken againſt Dr. <hi>St—s</hi> Argumentations) I could not but think, that to meddle any farther with the bare matter of fact, would ſavor more of a fond, or ambitious deſire of having the laſt word, than of any thing elſe: Eſpecially when other more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary employments required as much attendance from me at that time as my health could ſpare. And therefore to thoſe Proteſtants, who have ſpoken to me of this buſineſs, I have ſcarce ſaid any thing more, than <hi>that I deſired them to compare both Accounts,</hi> viz. <hi>Dr.</hi> St—s <hi>and mine, and then judge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think there was one thing new, whereof Mr. <hi>G—.</hi> was accuſed, in Dr. <hi>St—</hi>s ſecond Letter, viz. <hi>That over the ſecond Diſputation in ſome of Mr.</hi> G<hi>—s Copies, was written this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Stillingfleets Firſt Queſtion. <hi>Whereas</hi> (ſays the Doctor) <hi>the firſt Queſtion of that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation was put by Mr.</hi> T—. He looks on this as a wilful miſtake, and that it was deſigned to make the World believe, that the Doctor
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41662:11"/>
broke <note n="*" place="margin">How acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory the Dr. was to the breaking off of the firſt Diſputation is ſhewn in the Letter to Dr. <hi>E. S. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> off the firſt Diſputation. Now, I dare ſay, that this never came into Mr. <hi>G—s</hi> head, nor would come into any ones elſe, who was not at a very great loſs for Objections, and had not Authority enough to make a trifle paſs for one.</p>
               <p>The meaning of that Inſcription was, that as in the firſt Diſputation, Mr. <hi>G—</hi> was the Proponent and Dr. <hi>St—.</hi> the Reſpondent, ſo in this laſt Dr. <hi>St—.</hi> was the Proponent: For tho' Mr. <hi>T.</hi> put this firſt Queſtion, yet Dr. <hi>St—.</hi> abetted it, and was ſtill look'd on as the only perſon engaged in the Diſpute, and as ſuch he put all the reſt of the Queſtions. And this is the Explanation of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Inſcription. In which, I think, there was nothing to be blamed, ſave only the omiſſion of the Doctors Title.</p>
               <p>It doth not occur to me at preſent whether, or no, there were any other new accuſation in the forementioned Letter. But whatever there was, I am ſure, it was of no other complexion than this.</p>
               <p>I have ventured on this Digreſſion, not only to ſave my ſelf the trouble of a Book, but alſo that my Readers may know, what petty and wretched debates a Man muſt be engaged in, who is to give an account of Modern Conferences, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently how much Compaſſion the employment deſerves. But as miſerable as it is, I muſt now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to it.</p>
               <p>During my abovementioned Reply to Dr. <hi>Teni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> Objection, and after it, the Doctor ſtill grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; but to give him his due, his interruptions were always ſo thick whilſt I ſpoke, that I was not then aſſured, whether he attended to what I ſaid, or not.</p>

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41662:12"/>
Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſeeing Dr. <hi>T.</hi> diſſatisfied with my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, was unwilling, that the time ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in wrangling, which was deſigned for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and therefore offered the Doctor, that I ſhould withdraw and another Gentleman, who accidentally came in after us remain as a witneſs. Which, for my own part, I ſhould have agreed to without any great reſentment; for (I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs) the ſmall taſt I had of the Doctors Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, made me not over fond of his farther ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. But I did not find that the Doctor was mightily ſatisfied with this propoſal, who ſeemed to look after Exceptions more than Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, and was in no great haſt to begin the diſpute; and therefore I made another to him, which yet had the ill fortune to pleaſe him leſs. I told the Doctor, <hi>That he need not trouble himſelf, what witneſſes were preſent, That he ſhould appoint his own Writer, who ſhould Pen down what was ſaid by way of Argument on both ſides, and that this ſhould be looked on as the only Authentic account of what paſſed. This,</hi> I ſaid, <hi>would free the Doctor from all danger of being Miſrepreſented:</hi> And in this propoſal Mr. <hi>P.</hi> joyned with me and was very earneſt for it. The Doctor anſwered, <hi>that he had no Pen and Ink nor Writer</hi> [things hard to be come by in <hi>London]</hi> And then, all his Objections againſt me vaniſhing on the ſuddain, and inſiſting no longer on the clearing of the Room, he deſired Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and my ſelf to ſit down by him, ſaying, <hi>that he would Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on ſome Preliminaries,</hi> which I could make no other conſtruction of, than that Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> had much rather have to do with a witneſs, whoſe Credit he had taken care to leſſen, than with a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41662:12"/>
Record, the Teſtimony whereof had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted.</p>
               <p>It will be proper here to make ſome ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the Doctors Relation. He ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. that <hi>he eſpied Mr.</hi> Meredith <hi>in the Room, whom he look'd upon as next to a Prieſt.</hi> One would conclude by this expreſſion, that Dr. <hi>T.</hi> had known me, whereas by his queſtioning <hi>who I was, &amp;c.</hi> he ſeemed not to know me: But whether he diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled or not, I will not determin. He ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>that</hi> Mr. <hi>P. was content to diſmiſs all beſides a witneſs for himſelf, and Mr.</hi> Meredith <hi>was propoſed.</hi> This again looks, as if Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had brought ſeveral in his Company, and that having choſen me out of them for a witneſs, he was perſuaded to dimiſs the reſt; whereas on Dr. <hi>T—s</hi> firſt complaint, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> declared, <hi>that he had only brought me with him; That I came meerly to obſerve what paſſed in the Conference, and was not to diſpute in it. That if the Doctor did not approve of me, he would take another: Or, if the Doctor ſo pleaſed, he was content, that all ſhould retire, excepting only the Doctor himſelf, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Boy, for whoſe ſake (as Mr. P. had always underſtood) the Conference was held.</hi> How much of this is in the Doctors <hi>True Account?</hi> And yet the Doctor (if you will believe him <hi>pa.</hi> 43.) is too blunt a Man, to be a Man of Artifice.</p>
               <p>After this he ſays: <hi>Againſt Mr.</hi> Meredith, Dr. T. <hi>made three Objections:</hi> And again, <hi>pa.</hi> 5. <hi>After theſe exceptions taken at Mr.</hi> M. <hi>as a witneſs, Dr.</hi> T. <hi>perceiving it next to impoſſible to clear the Room,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>called Mr.</hi> Meredith <hi>to him.</hi> Whereas he called me to him on mine and Mr. <hi>P—s</hi> propoſing to have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41662:13"/>
the Controverſie taken in writing, and he had then made but one of his Objections againſt me. And then for the <hi>Impoſſibility of clearing the Room,</hi> the Doctor never put it to the Tryal; nor came to any agreement with Mr. <hi>P.</hi> about it: I am ſure, that the Room might very eaſily have been cleared of my Company, and therefore I wonder, how the Doctor after ſuch ſolid <hi>exceptions taken at</hi> Mr. <hi>M. as a witneſs,</hi> came to <hi>call Mr.</hi> Meredith <hi>to him, and place himſelf between Mr.</hi> P. <hi>and Mr.</hi> Meredith.</p>
               <p>One would think, that Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> were fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a piece of Dramatic Poetry, and that he thought it allowable for him to vary from the true Hiſtory, as often as it was for the advantage of his work, which (as the Reader will perceive by what he finds here) is very often. Indeed the Doctors Narrative is like the wrong ſide of the Hangings, where there is nothing right, or in its due proportion, but a confuſed Reſemblance of what it ſhould be. And this is ſufficient to deceive thoſe, who are (either by intereſt or humor) very willing to be deceived.</p>
               <p>The Doctor then ſitting down, and cauſing us (Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and my ſelf) to place our ſelves by him, ſaid (as I have already told you) that <hi>he would treat of ſome Preliminaries.</hi> But the Coaſt being now clear, and in appearance the danger of having the Arguments Penn'd down, quite over, Dr. <hi>Teni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> (perhaps for my having been ſo unfortunate as to propoſe Writing) was reſolved to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bout with me. He told me, <hi>that he had other Objections againſt me, and</hi>

                     <hi>Dr.</hi> T's <hi>2d. Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me.</hi>

                  <hi>one was, that I had been</hi>

                  <hi>already Diſpoſing of his Pariſh, and had canton'd it out for Fryers.</hi> This Objection I muſt confeſs was a moſt ſenſible one; but it was not more touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctor, than it was aſtoniſhing to me, ſince I could not remember, that I had ever had the leaſt thought of any ſuch thing. But the Dr. adding, <hi>That I had ſaid, his Benefice would maintain Thirty Fryers, and that his friend Captain</hi> O. <hi>had given him the Information;</hi> I diſcovered whence this grand Objection had it's riſe, or rather it's pretence. I called to mind, that in ſome diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes concerning the great want of Charity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Zeal, which had come into the World to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Reformation, or (if you pleaſe) uſher'd it in; amongſt other things I ſaid, <hi>that this appeared not only in the diſcontinuance of</hi> Miſſions <hi>abroad for the Converſion of Infidels, but likewiſe in the ſcarcity of Pious and Charitable</hi> works <hi>at home.</hi> I inſtanced particularly, <hi>that whilſt Men were buſie in Building</hi> private Houſes, <hi>they took no care for</hi> Churches: <hi>And that hence it came to paſs, that the Pariſhes in the Suburbs were unreaſonably large; and that it muſt needs be impoſſible for the Curates and thoſe few Readers their Aſſiſtants to comply with the Duties belonging to their Employments, in ſuch manner as they ought.</hi> I obſerved, <hi>that in the Pariſhes within the Walls (which were Eſtabliſhed before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) there ſeldom died above one or two a week in each Pariſh, and in ſome of the out-Pariſhes there died (for the moſt part) forty or fifty: So that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proportion appointed by our Anceſtors, we ought to have thirty, or forty Pariſhes and Pariſh-Churches inſtead of one.</hi> I ſaid farther, <hi>that where forty or fifty died in a week, there were probably ten, or</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:41662:14"/>
                  <hi>twenty times as many ſick, and in danger of death: Who</hi> would <hi>all ſtand in need of their Paſtors help: And how could it be poſſible for one Man (or indeed any ten Men) to viſit a thouſand perſons every week, (which amounted to more than a hundred and forty a day, one day with another) ſtaying with them ſo much time, as was neceſſary for the giving them the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and doing all thoſe other things which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be done by the</hi> Common-Prayer-Book <hi>in the</hi> Viſitation of the Sick, <hi>as alſo for the Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Exhorting, and Comforting them, as occaſion ſhall be ſeen?</hi> I ſaid, <hi>how could it be poſſible for ſo ſmall a number of Men to do all this, and yet at the ſame time comply with all their other Parochial Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſuch as were,</hi> Reading Common-Prayer <hi>Daily,</hi> Preaching <hi>once or twice a Week,</hi> Marrying, Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſtening, Catechizing, Reconciling En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, Reſolving Doubts, <hi>with many other things of this kind, which are incumbent on Curates, and whereof there is ſcarce any one Branch, which in theſe large Pariſhes is not enough, if not too much, for one Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[Wherefore for the future, Dr. <hi>T.</hi> needs not take ſo much pains to convince the World, that he is able to Diſpute againſt Nine Jeſuits at once, ſince thoſe who can believe that he performs what of neceſſity muſt be incumbent on him in two ſuch populous Pariſhes, as he poſſeſſes, will eaſily be perſwaded, that he is able to make his party good againſt forty of thoſe Fathers. Nay, he may well be equal to Nine Prieſts, who has the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of above an Hundred.]</p>
               <p>I ſaid likewiſe, <hi>That I had heard, there were Thirty Thouſand Communicants belonging to St.</hi> Martins
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41662:14"/>
                  <hi>Pariſh, if not more; that if theſe ſhould have a mind to Aſſemble together for the receiving the Sacrament, or hearing a Sermon, it would not be poſſible for them to do it, The Church (as I ſuppoſed) not being able to contain one quarter of that number; and that the</hi> Engliſh Clergy <hi>ought not to wonder, that there were ſo many</hi> Diſſenters, <hi>ſince their Pariſhioners were forced to go to Meeting-houſes for Elbow-room, or even for any opportunity of doing ſomething like the</hi> ſerving of God. And for this reaſon They ought not to have manifeſted ſo much Zeal for the Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Conventicles, till the fervor of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations had inſpir'd More into their hearers for the Building of Churches.</p>
               <p>To this I added, <hi>That over and above, that in Catholic Countries the</hi> Pariſh Prieſts <hi>were more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and held a better proportion with their Flocks, than amongſt us, there were great numbers of</hi> Regulars, <hi>or</hi> Religious <hi>Men, who were no ſmall aſſiſtance to the</hi> Secular Clergy <hi>in</hi> ſaying Maſs, Preaching, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing, Hearing Confeſſions <hi>and the like. But, that this</hi> (I meant, <hi>ſuch a plentiful proviſion of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Guides) was not ſo practisable in</hi> England, <hi>in regard that moſt of the</hi> Engliſh Curates <hi>had Families to provide for, and conſequently ſtood in need of greater Benefices, than thoſe who had obliged themſelves to a ſingle Life: And for the ſame reaſon, what was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for many Paſtors beyond Seas, would ſcarce be enough for one here. Eſpecially,</hi> I ſaid, <hi>the</hi> Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars <hi>were maintained for very little, and that</hi> 600 <hi>l. per annum (which I heard the Parſonage of St.</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins <hi>was worth,</hi> tho' perhaps it may be more) <hi>would keep Thirty of them, at leaſt with the conve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41662:15"/>
ſuch Diſcourſes as theſe, I do confeſs, that I have made more than once; and particularly I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that I ſpake ſomewhat of this kind to C. <hi>O.</hi> and I am ſo far from being aſhamed of it, that I cannot but think that the cauſe of ſhame lies at their door, who are more concerned for the extent of their Juriſdiction or Profit, than for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Souls committed to their care: And when I underſtand that Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> is one of thoſe, it is then, that I ſhall begin to do, what he ſaid I had done, <hi>viz. pity the State of St.</hi> Martins.</p>
               <p>It was according to what I have ſaid here, that I anſwered the Doctor telling him withal, <hi>that I had ſpoken of the largeneſs of the</hi> Out-Pariſhes <hi>in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and not of</hi> his <hi>in particular:</hi> And this (as one would have thought) would have ſatisfied any reaſonable Man. But the French ſay, <hi>A ſcalded Cat dreads cold Water,</hi> and it ſeems the Doctor (which I then knew nothing of) had ſo deep an <note n="*" place="margin">See the Drs. Epiſtle to his Pariſhioners.</note> 
                  <hi>Impreſſion made on him in his Youth</hi> by the loſs of his Fathers Benefice, that now the leaſt hint, which ſo much as brings it to his mind, <hi>raiſes his Suſpicion and Indignation</hi> to an high degree.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Doctor ſeemed to take it ill, that I undervalued the <hi>Reformed Charity,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>that there were too many Churches within the Walls,</hi> and <hi>that in ſome places there were two in one Church-Yard.</hi> He talked ſomewhat likewiſe, of <hi>an Act of Parliament for Building of Twelve new Churches for the Suburbs,</hi> which was no ſmall confirmation of what I had ſaid of the want of them. I looked on that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive way of doing good Works as not ſo <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Certainly the Statute of</hi> Mortmain <hi>was a better ſign of the Charity of former Ages, than this Act for building Churches is of that of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41662:15"/>
therefore I told the Doctor, <hi>that it argued ſome defect in</hi> theirs, <hi>that it ſtood in need of</hi> Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>for doing things, which were, in a manner, abſolutely neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctor anſwered, that <hi>he wiſh'd, he could ſee ſome of our Charity,</hi> or ſome ſuch like words. What he meant by this wiſh, I could not well tell, <hi>viz.</hi> whether he would have us employ our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Liberty in Building Churches, that, when time ſerved, they might diſpoſſeſs us of them, as they did of our Antient ones, and ſo be Provided without burthening the People by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſomething elſe? In this doubt I asked him only, <hi>whether he would have us Build Churches now in</hi> England? To which he made me no anſwer, but ſeemed to attempt ſomething for the proof of Proteſtant Charity. But all, that I can remember he ſaid, was, that <hi>he would not brag of himſelf:</hi> Which I eſteemed a Rhetorical way of doing it. And certainly he muſt needs be put hard to it for an inſtance of <hi>Charity,</hi> who is forced ſo far to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon <hi>Humility</hi> for it, as to begin with himſelf.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant, (all this while) that ſome Hoſpitals, Alms-houſes and Churches have been Built by Proteſtants: But there is more proportion between Dr. <hi>Teniſons</hi> two Pariſhes and a couple of the pooreſt Vicaridges in <hi>Wales,</hi> than there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Monuments of Catholic Zeal, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>For ſome proof of what is here ſaid, ſee a Book lately Primed at</hi> Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, <hi>called</hi> Pietas Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na &amp; Pariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſis. <hi>By which in ſome meaſure the reſt may be gueſſed.</hi>
                  </note> and whatever of that kind hath been done by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. It will be a great while before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation builds the fortieth part of what it hath pulled down. Nay, (ſuppoſing that this poor Nation is not to return to it's Antient Religion)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41662:16"/>
there is more likely-hood, that Reformations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing one another, like Egyptian Plagues, the ſucceeding ones ſhould ſtill devour what the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding leave, than that Men who have taken Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege for the Service of God, ſhould endeavor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair any part of that which is already Deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>The Doctor having finiſhed his Second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, put an end to my defence, by bringing on his Third, without telling me, whether he thought, that what I ſaid was true, or if it were, whether he judged it ſatisfactory, or not. But every Man minds his own buſineſs: And it was not the Doctor's to Abſolve, but to Accuſe. <hi>There is yet</hi> (ſaid the Doctor) <hi>another</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>That which then immediately occurred to me for an Anſwer, was the parallel of what I had often heard from Proteſtants, concerning ſuch as turn to them, <hi>viz. That I was then the better judge, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving known the Doctrins of both Churches.</hi> But I had forgotten, that what is <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>When Church of</hi> England-men <hi>diſpute with Diſſenters, Church Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is of great force, and no Scripture is of private Interpretation:—But When Catholics argue with them, the caſe is alter'd, and every Man is to be his own Judge.</hi>
                  </note> reaſon in a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants mouth, is ſtark naught in a Catholics. The Doctor replyed, <hi>That I went away Young from their Church, and that if I had underſtood it better, I ſhould not have left it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know not what the Doctor accounts <hi>Young:</hi> But it was not, till I had gone through one of the beſt and moſt careful <note n="*" place="margin">Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-School.</note> Schools in <hi>England,</hi> and ſpent above three years at the Univerſity, and as many in <hi>Spain.</hi> And I queſtion not, but the Doctors of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41662:16"/>
the Church of <hi>England</hi> will allow, that after all this I muſt needs have been come to the Age of <hi>judging for my ſelf,</hi> ſince I find that for this Liberty in others they do not require ſo much Education, as mine amounted to. And had it been ſo, that I had embraced the Roman Catholic Religion without ſufficient conſideration, the laſt fifteen, or ſixteen years, which I have lived in it, had been time enough for the Correction of an Error, which my Intereſt, and Neceſſities would have prompted me to have laid aſide. But (I thank God) I have not been the leaſt ſhaken in my Faith ever ſince my Converſion, either by what I have ſeen written, or heard ſpoken by the moſt Learned Proteſtants. But on the contrary I have been ſo far from repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I turned ſo Young, that the more I read or diſcourſed of theſe matters, the more I diſcerned the Excellence of the Catholic Religion on the one hand, and the blindneſs of ſo many of my fellow Creatures on the other, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently I had no other cauſes for grief, than firſt, that my Converſion was no ſooner, and next, that I had not yet been grateful enough, that it was ſo ſoon.</p>
               <p>The Doctor ſays, that <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> no Man, who well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands their Church, departs from it, upon true Principles. And I am much miſtaken, if there be not very many, who know well enough what the Church of <hi>England</hi> Teaches, and yet depart from her, on no other principles than thoſe which they learnt from her ſelf, <hi>viz. That the Church is to be followed no farther than ſhe agrees with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and every particular Man is left to judge how far ſhe agrees with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:41662:17"/>
It would be tedious and unneceſſary to ſet down here all thoſe Principles or Motives, upon which I departed from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſince I cannot ſo much pretend to extraordinary things as to deny, but that they are the ſame, which have led others from her both before and ſince, and may be ſeen at large in many Books. However, (if my Readers will give me leave) I will lay before them ſome of thoſe Points which began my doubts, and prevail'd more particularly with me.</p>

And Laſtly, that I my ſelf had been ſo happy as to be one of this number.</p>
               <p>This was that Idea of Chriſtianity, which I then had: For as to what they talk'd of a conſtant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Proteſtants from the fifth Age down to our times, I had never heard it from any Wiſe Man, nor indeed can ſuch an Impoſture find place with any one, who is ſo much an Hiſtorian, as the common Diſcourſe will make him. Every body knows, that the firſt Reformers, when they left
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41662:17"/>
the Roman Church, joyned with no other Society or Sect of Chriſtians then in the World either in Communion or Doctrin, which muſt have been done, had this pretended Succeſſion continued. Their pretence was at that time to Reform the whole Church, and not to ſeek out any True one, which then had a Being, and ſtood in no need of Reformation. Nay, they were ſo far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it neceſſary to joyn with any former Church in order to the preſerving a Succeſſion, that they did not unite with one another: But parted their ſtock, and each Adventurer ſet up for himſelf.</p>
               <p>This then was the moſt Rational Account, that I could give of my Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Church finding, that all Chriſtian Churches had been in Error for a Thouſand Years, forſook that Error, and reformed it ſelf according to the pattern of the firſt Five Hundred Years after Chriſt. For to be of a Chriſtian Church, which never had any being from Chriſts time till this preſent, I thought a moſt unreaſonable thing.</p>
               <p>Now, none can write after a Copy without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that Copy which they pretend to Write by. I mean, it was impoſſible for the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to Reform it ſelf according to the firſt Five Hundred Years of Chriſtianity, without knowing what thoſe Chriſtians Taught and Practis'd. And how could this poſſibly be done, but by the Holy Fathers and other Writers of thoſe times? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I firmly believed (as I am perſuaded many Thouſands do) that theſe Writers were meer ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to all thoſe Doctrins which we had forſaken, and conſequently, that no mention was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them of <hi>Purgatory, Prayer for the Dead,</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:41662:18"/>
                  <hi>Invocation of Saints, Veneration of Holy Images and Relics, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the Reality of Chriſts Fleſh in the Euchariſt, the Deciſive Authority of the Church in Controverſial matters, the Spiritual Supremacy of St.</hi> Peter <hi>and his Succeſſors,</hi> with ſome other things of this nature; I ſay, I took it for granted, that nothing of all this was to be found in thoſe Primitive Records of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But when I looked into them I found it quite otherwiſe, and that thoſe things, which hitherto I had accounted Novelties, were as clearly ſet down in theſe Writings as any other Points of Chriſtian Doctrin. For inſtances, to avoid length, I will refer my Readers to a Book not long ſince Publiſhed, Entituled, <hi>Nubes Teſtium,</hi> which hath Collections out of ſome of thoſe Books which then fell into my hands, and muſt weigh with Men of any tolerable moderation, notwithſtanding that which is, or can be ſaid againſt it.</p>
               <p>Now, what was there for me to be done in this condition? I had taken it on truſt, that I was a Member of a Church which had Copied out the firſt Five Hundred Years, but found my Error.</p>
               <p>It was not unknown to me, that ſeveral Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of the Fathers were produced in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Proteſtant Opinions: But-to me they all ſeemed wreſted, or, at leaſt, capable of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which were not repugnant to what the ſame Fathers more plainly and fully ſpeak in other places for a contrary Doctrin. In a word, what appeared to me in favor of the Catholic Cauſe was clear, full, and incapable of any other meaning, But that which offered it ſelf in oppoſition to it was obſcure, ſhort and interpretable in another ſenſe;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41662:18"/>
and indeed, for the moſt part, evidently requiring another, when joyned to it's antecedents and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents.</p>
               <p>Others ſaid, <hi>That the Fathers were Men and had Errors, and that they contradicted one another, and themſelves to boot.</hi> But this Plea was as little to my ſatisfaction as the former: For this ſerves only to weaken the Authority of the Fathers, and if good, evinces nothing, but that They are not to be relyed on. And then, how can the Church of <hi>England</hi> make out, that ſhe follows the firſt Five Hundred Years, when ſhe hath no other means of knowing what was believed in thoſe times, but by ſuch Authors as are not to be truſted?</p>
               <p>For what ſome People ſay, of our being able to know by Scripture what was the Belief and Practice of theſe Primitive Chriſtians, is wholly abſurd: For we know not from Scripture (at leaſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Principles of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> whether the Chriſtians of the firſt Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, lived according to the Scripture, or not. The Scripture does not tell us of a Church, which is to continue only to the end of the Fifth Age. It tells us, indeed, of one <hi>which is to continue to the End of the World:</hi> And this Church (I hope) may be found as well in the Fourteenth Age, as in the Fifth. For if all the Chriſtians of the Fourteenth were Erroneous and Corrupted, and ſtood in need of Reformation, thoſe of the Fifth might have been ſo too, for any thing which the Scriptures can aſſure us to the contrary.</p>
               <p>This Rock then of my Proteſtant Faith being ſhaken, I mean, a Belief, that the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had Model'd it ſelf according to the Doctrins
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41662:19"/>
of the firſt Five Hundred Years, it will not be wonder'd at, if (at leaſt) I gave way to ſome doubts.</p>
               <p>I found no better footing in that way, which was taken by thoſe Church of <hi>England-men,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed more with Roman Catholics than with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Diſſenters, <hi>viz. Scripture, as it is underſtood by every private Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe thoſe who took that way differed from one another in moſt material things, and alſo, Such as were eſteemed Heretics by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> followed the ſame Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe according to my own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (who were by this Rule to judge for my ſelf) the Church of <hi>England</hi> was beholding to Tradition for ſome Parts of her Doctrin and Practice, as <hi>Infant-Baptiſm, the Obſervation of the firſt Day of the Week,</hi> and the like, having no clear Scripture for them, and therefore could not hold them, and require them to be held, by the Rule of Scripture Interpreted without the help of Tradition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe it was ſincerely my own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Scripture was much clearer for the Catholics than for the Proteſtants, particularly in <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Sacramental Confeſſion, Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, Purgatory, St.</hi> Peters <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and laſtly and chiefly (being that which includes all other Points) the <hi>Deciſive Authority of the Church;</hi> wherefore if I muſt follow Scripture Interpreted by my ſelf, I muſt at the ſame time neceſſarily ceaſe to follow the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe certainly were Motives, if not for an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute departure from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet ſtill, at leaſt (as I have already hinted) for the doubting of her Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:41662:19"/>
About this time I remember, that I had two no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Faith was not that which muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuit with the Fancies of particular Men (ſince then it ought to be as various as thoſe Fancies were) but it was that, which God would have us believe, whether we fancied it or not, <hi>viz.</hi> That, which he would have us <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bringing into Captivity all underſtanding into the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 5.</note> ſubmit our Fancies and Judgments to, meerly becauſe it was revealed by him. And in this ſubmiſſion (as I thought) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted both the Difficulty and Merit of Faith. And conſequently, that I ought not ſo much to conſider the nature of the things propoſed to be believed, as the Authority by which they were propoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Faith was the <note n="*" place="margin">Epheſ. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note> Gift of God, and for that reaſon, that more confidence was to be put in humbe Prayer for the obtaining it, than in any Human Skill or Induſtry. Wherefore (as far as God Almighties Grace aſſiſted my weakneſs) I endeavored to obtain this Gift by that means, making it my earneſt Prayer to his Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I might know the Truth, and firmly purpoſing to embrace that which I ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of, tho' it ſhould be ever ſo contrary to my Worldly Intereſt, as the Roman Catholic Religion at that time moſt apparently was.</p>
               <p>To Prayer I judged it neceſſary to add a ſerious endeavor of amending my Life, leſt otherwiſe I ſhould be found to ſue Hypocritically for more light from Almighty God, whilſt I made no uſe of that which I had received from him by comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with what I already knew to be his Will. This is a Point, which all thoſe, who are in ſearch of the True Faith, ought to examin their Conſciences
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41662:20"/>
upon, and therefore I would not omit the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it in this place.</p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe doubts I confeſs ingenuouſly, that what our Engliſh Doctors have made ſo light of, was of great moment with me, <hi>viz. That the Church of</hi> England-men <hi>affirmed, that Salvation might be had amongſt the Roman Catholics; but the Roman Catholics abſolutely denyed, that the like was to be had amongſt them.</hi> For Salvation in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Communion both Churches concurr'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as for the latter, we had only the bare word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in their own behalf; Who likewiſe at the ſame time told us, they were fallible, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, for ought they knew, might be miſtaken. And if they were actually <hi>miſtaken,</hi> I ſhould be undone by rarrying with them; whereas on the other ſide, if they were <hi>not miſtaken,</hi> I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no damage by being amongſt the Roman Catholics. In a word, I conſidered, that if the Proteſtants were true, I ſhould be ſafe with the Roman Catholics; but, if the Roman Catholics were right, I could not be ſo with the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</p>
               <p>This Motive is ſo ſtrong in it's own Nature, that many Proteſtants confeſs, that it muſt needs have great Power with thoſe, who (as they ſay) cannot throughly examin the differences betwixt us; and theſe I take to be the greateſt part of Mankind. And if ſo, I will venture to add, that GOD Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty having taken as much care of the Ignorant, as of the Learned, would never permit Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood to be ſupported by ſuch Arguments, as muſt in common Prudence oblige all unlearned perſons to be engaged in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41662:20"/>
But above all methinks, this Argument ſhould be of force with thoſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Gentlemen, who pretend, that their Religion is the Catholic, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe nothing, but that wherein all agree, forgetting, that ſuch a Reſtraint of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is <hi>peculiar</hi> to themſelves, and not <hi>common;</hi> whereas here is an Agreement of all Parties (at leaſt, ſuch as have any Eſteem with them) on which they may ſafely rely, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Salvation</hi> may be had in the Roman Catholic Church, which is all, we do, or at leaſt ought to aim at by our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. As for thoſe other Points, which perhaps they hold, <hi>viz. A Deity, a Saviour,</hi> and the like, tho' they have the univerſal conſent of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for their Truth; yet they have it not for their ſufficiency to Salvation (eſpecially ſo as to exclude the Neceſſity of believing other Articles, when they are duly propoſed) and it will be of ſmall Conſequence to them, that what they hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with others, proves True, if their additional Article, which holds <hi>this Truth to be ſufficient,</hi> ſhould prove Falſe.</p>
               <p>What was urged in derogation of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if the Proteſtants ſhew'd a greater Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by thinking well of Catholics, than Catholics did by thinking ill of them, was nothing to my purpoſe<hi>:</hi> For I was then in ſearch of True Faith, and not of Charity, and knew withal, that how great appearance ſoever there might be of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it could not be Real, unleſs it were grounded on <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 6.</note> Orthodox Faith.</p>
               <p>It ſeemed to me to be a ſurer mark of Charity for Men to adventure both Eſtate and Life, for the Converſion of others, as formerly the Apoſtles
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41662:21"/>
and now the Catholic Miſſioners did, than to keep at home, and in our warm Beds, and cry, <hi>We hope</hi> (or we declare) <hi>they may be ſaved, tho' they are in an Error.</hi> Which, if it were a Charity, was in my opinion a very Lazy one<hi>:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, if the Proteſtant Religion were falſe, it was more Charitable in the Catholics to tell them ſo, than by ſoothing them in their Error, to engage them faſter to it. Wherefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ought not to fetch an Argument (as ſome moſt unreaſonably do) for the Truth of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from their having (as they imagin) a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Charity than Catholics, ſince it muſt firſt be proved, that their Religion is true, before it will appear, that the Catholics want Charity in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If it muſt paſs for a Sign of Charity to think well of more Religions than one, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tenets will have the advantage of the Nine and Thirty Articles, foraſmuch as the Mahometans declare, that every one will be ſaved in his own Religion, and the Articles on the other ſide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Salvation to the <note n="*" place="margin">See 18th. Article.</note> Chriſtians only. But both theſe <hi>Charitable</hi> Religions muſt give way to the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniſts,</hi> who will have neither Men nor Devils to be <hi>Eternally</hi> Damned.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is apparent, that this plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Greater Charity</hi> weakens not the force of the forementioned Argument, but leaves it Such, as that the moſt cautious Chriſtian may ſafely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on it; Nay, the more <hi>cautious</hi> a Man is in his everlaſting concerns, the better and ſafer this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument will appear to him. For, thoſe who have a quicker Senſe of their Temporal Intereſts, than
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41662:21"/>
their Spiritual, will not ſo much conſult, what is ſafe for their Souls as what is ſecure for their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. And if both cannot be made ſure alike they will truſt a ſcanty probability (or rather an Improbability) with the former, ſo that they may have Demonſtration (which yet, Gods knows, can be but Imaginary) for the latter.</p>
               <p>Now, what would Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> have me do in theſe circumſtances? Would he have me Read the Scriptures? <hi>Iread them:</hi> Would he have me peruſe the Fathers? <hi>I did it without his advice.</hi> Would he have me make uſe of (what he calls) <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> Miniſterial Guides? <hi>I heard the Inſtructions of the Engliſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for many Years.</hi> Would he have me pray? <hi>I looked on Prayer as the chief means of obtaining true Faith, and therefore omitted it not.</hi> Would he have me be humble? <hi>In this Point I can only ſay, that during this ſearch I had ſo mean an Opinion of my own underſtanding, that I could not but conclude, that Almighty God, whoſe Providential care appeared in all other things, had likewiſe provided ſome</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Such a guide muſt be one who could not Err himſelf</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Infallible.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Guide for me, that I might not Err in ſo important a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, as that muſt needs be, without which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe him,</hi> viz. <note n="*" place="margin">Ut ſupra <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore having thus far obſerved (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) the Doctors directions, what would he have me do after all? Doth he require the interior Senſe, he ſpeaks of, <hi>pa.</hi> 10? <hi>That alſo pleaded for the Roman Catholics.</hi> And now, if this be all he looks after, would he have me (according to what he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 15.) <hi>at laſt</hi> Judge for my ſelf? Why then, <hi>I do Judge, and Pronounce too, (I mean</hi> for my ſelf) <hi>that Holy Scriptures, Antient Fathers and Common Reaſon are all for the Roman Catholics, and againſt the Proteſtants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:41662:22"/>
And what ſhall interpoſe between this Sentence and it's Execution, I mean, between Concluding, that the Roman Catholic Religion is the beſt, and Embracing it as ſuch? Doth the Church of <hi>England</hi> pretend, that I ought to ſubmit my private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her Public Deciſions? <hi>She doth not: Nor, if ſhe did, would Dr.</hi> Teniſon <hi>be her Advocate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore to conclude, if Dr. <hi>T—.</hi> (being as I conceive, no great friend to Retractations of this kind) will ſtill affirm, that I departed from the Church of <hi>England</hi> on <hi>falſe Principles,</hi> he muſt at leaſt acknowledge, that thoſe <hi>principles</hi> were ſuch as I had received from her. So that in effect I am cenſured by my Teachers for doing that very thing, which they Taught me to do. An hard caſe and that which certainly muſt prevail with us to obſerve our Saviours Command in being <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. c. 7. v. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>aware</hi> of ſuch Teachers for the future!</p>
               <p>I have ſaid nothing here <hi>(at leaſt,</hi> directly) of the marks of the True Church, <hi>viz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Univerſality, Perpetuity, Converſion of Infidels</hi> and the like, nor of many other things, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd at that time to convince me of the truth of of the Religion I embraced: But thus much I have ſaid, that, ſince Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> hath been pleaſed to make the World acquainted with my Converſion, it may not be wholly ignorant of thoſe Motives which occaſioned it. And ſince we are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ready always to ſatisfie every one that asketh you a Reaſon of that Hope which is in you,</hi> 1 Pet. c. 3. v. 15.</note> to give a Reaſon of the hope, which is in us, to every one that asks, when we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided with our change in this public manner, the public ſeems to demand this Reaſon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently we ſeem to lie under an obligation of rendring it. Which, I hope will excuſe me with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41662:22"/>
my Readers, for ſo long a Comment on the Doctors Text.</p>
               <p>And now (to return to my Remarks) methinks Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> conceiving, that I had left his Church for want of due Information, ought not to have preſs'd ſo much for my being excluded from that Conference, but rather to have been glad of this opportunity, wherein by his great Learning he might have rectified my underſtanding and been a means of reducing me to one of his two fair Flocks, <hi>viz.</hi> to St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the <hi>Fields,</hi> or St. <hi>James Weſtminſter:</hi> For tho' thoſe Flocks are ſo numerous, that one ſtray Sheep can hardly be found miſſing, yet (we know) it was the property heretofore of a good Shepherd to leave the Ninty Nine, that he might ſeek after the Hundredth [this being, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in former days a competent number for one Shepherd] I ſay, it had been a clearer ſign not only of the Doctors Charity, but alſo of his confidence in the goodneſs of his cauſe, to have admitted me to his Conference, than to pretend <hi>my turning Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholic through Ignorance,</hi> as an Argument, for the ſending me away, and conſequently, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving me of (what he ought to think) an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of being better informed.</p>
               <p>But perhaps, the Doctor who thought this Conference <note n="*" place="margin">Pa. 3. <hi>And yet D.</hi> T. <hi>was diſpleaſed with Mr.</hi> P <hi>for propoſing a Rule of Faith for the Subject of that Conference, becauſe it was not that point which the Boy had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to him,</hi> viz. <hi>of</hi> Luther, <hi>whereas had be deſigned a more public Good (as be ſeems to pretend, Mr.</hi> P's <hi>Queſtion was the more proper.</hi>

And it is on this account, that I have often ſaid amongſt my Proteſtant acquaintance, that <hi>I wiſhed they were but Catholics for one half hour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> ſays, that thoſe who forſake the Church of <hi>England</hi> for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 5.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And it is this <hi>zeal</hi> (as I conjecture) which the Doctor calls <hi>Bigottry.</hi> Wherein he imitates the reſt of the World, who think it ſufficient, for the diſcredit of a Vertue, to miſ-name it.

               <p>But whereas the Doctor fancies, that original

Romaniſts would be more propitious to his Party than Converts: If I may gueſs by my own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, he is much miſtaken. It has been my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that ſome who have been bred Catholics from the beginning, having never been without that clearneſs wherewith the Truth of our Holy Faith is repreſented to them, are very hardly to be perſuaded, but that ſuch Proteſtants as Dr. <hi>Teni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, viz. Men of ſome Learning,</hi> muſt needs know that they are in the wrong, and conſequently, perſiſting in it, be Hypocrites. And indeed, the Motives for the Catholic Faith are ſo palpably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent throughout all the Writings of the Antient Fathers and Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians, (which ought to come into the hands of thoſe who pretend to the Study of Divinity) that I believe I ſhould have been very apt to have Joyned with them in this cenſure, had I been unacquainted with the prejudices of Inclination, Education and Intereſt, or with thoſe obſcurities which they never fail of bringing upon the mind: Whereunto may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that blindneſs, which God Almighty often <note n="*" place="margin">Spargit Deus paenales caecitates ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per illicitas cupiditates. <hi>Aug, Confeſſ.</hi>
                  </note> inflicts on us for the puniſhment of our other Sins. But as it is, and in regard that I have been under the ſame circumſtances, tho' not with ſo much Learning, <hi>haud ignarus mali, miſeris ſuccur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere diſco</hi> [I have ſpoiled the Verſe, that I might not Err in the <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 10.</note> Gender, the Doctor being, as I ſee, curious in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And when the Doctor ſhall have conſidered theſe things well, I believe that if the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41662:24"/>
his Profeſſion ſhould come to be tryed by a Jury of Catholics, he would not prefer Original ones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Converts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>No Gentlemen, Converts are not fiercer towards you, than other Catholics, but you deal leſs fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with others than with them; the Yellowneſs which appears to a Jaundic'd perſon is not in the Object but in his Eye. The fierceneſs is in your breſt towards the Converts, and not in theirs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you. And this the Doctor knows well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and therefore hath recommended me under ſo advantagious a Character to the acquaintance of his Pariſhioners. Which (as he thinks) will ſtand me in ſome ſtead another day.</p>
               <p>Now it is not hard to gueſs at the Reaſon, why Converts are more ſeverely handled by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Neighbors than other Catholics<hi>: [and the nearer, for the moſt part, the Neighbr-hood, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is, the rougher the uſage.]</hi> It is becauſe, when a Proteſtant is Converted, we are more ſenſibly put in mind of what we ought to do, than by thoſe who have never been otherwiſe than Catholics. [And by a Neighbor, or Kinſ-man, ſtill more <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly</hi> than by a ſtranger, or one at a diſtance] We are diſturbed by ſuch an Example in that drouſie Principle, <hi>that every one ought to continue in that Church wherein he was</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Some go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſay, that Men ought to continue in that Religion wherein they were Educated, whether it be Chriſtian, or not.</note> 
                  <hi>Baptized.</hi> And we are ſuch ſtupid Lovers of eaſe, that we are angry at ſuch as endeavor to awaken us out of our Sleep, at leaſt till we come to be thoroughly <hi>awake,</hi> and ſo underſtand, that had it not been for this Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Troubleſomeneſs,</hi> we ſhould have been burnt in our Beds. I ſay, this Principle, of <hi>abiding in that Communion where we once are,</hi> is more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41662:25"/>
attack'd by Converts than by others, and therefore of conſequence the Converts are more diſpleaſing to thoſe, who have made a ſhift to lay their Conſciences a-ſleep upon it. And yet how much ſoever this Principle is belov'd at preſent, it is that which the Proteſtants (if they have any kindneſs for their Religion) have no reaſon to be fond of, ſince, if this Rule had been always obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, their Reformation had not been, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the World had ſtill continued without any Proteſtants at all.</p>
               <p>There is yet one remark which offers it ſelf to me concerning this Aſperſion which the Doctor is pleaſed to caſt on all Converts, <hi>viz.</hi> That it reflects on me in very good Company: But I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on this, leaſt the Doctor who confeſſes, he is apt to be <note n="*" place="margin">Ep. to his Pariſhioners.</note> Suſpicious, ſhould have a freſh occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuſpecting (as he did at the Conference) that I intend to inform againſt him: However for the future (as I told him then) I would have him take a little more time to conſider, before he ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>When the Doctor told me, that <hi>I had been turn'd in</hi> Spain, <hi>where the People had no Bibles,</hi> what I replyed was very true, <hi>viz.</hi> that going over in the Company of a public Miniſter, we had the liberty of uſing what Books we pleaſed, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we carried with us not only Bibles, but a great number of other Engliſh Books and amongſt them many of our beſt Proteſtant Controvertiſts. And I farther inform the Doctor, that during my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned doubts, I frequently peruſed the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thoſe Men, and particularly of <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41662:25"/>
whom I looked on as the ſubtileſt of them all, and the Fountain-head from whence Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and moſt others of our Modern Controverſie-writers had derived their Notions. And before my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to the beſt of my remembrance, I never Read one line in any Roman Catholic Controvertiſt (having always an in-bred averſion to, and a fear of being deceived by them) unleſs the Doctor will take the Antient Fathers to be ſuch, as indeed, he very well may.</p>
               <p>But after all, why ſhould the Doctor ſay, that I have <hi>forſaken</hi> his Church? Does a Man leave the Houſe, who goes out of one Room into another? The <hi>Learned Dr.</hi> Jackſon (as he is <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 58.</note> Quoted by <hi>the Learned</hi> Dr. <hi>Teniſon)</hi> ſays, that <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>was in the Romiſh Church before</hi> Luthers <hi>time, and is yet in it.</hi> Now, how have I left the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when both the Church of <hi>England</hi> and my ſelf are in the ſame Church? <hi>London</hi> is no farther from <hi>Paris,</hi> than <hi>Paris</hi> is from <hi>London.</hi> If the Church of <hi>England</hi> could come ſo far from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſhe hath done by her Reformation, without Separating from her (as the Doctor ſeems to <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> affirm;) may not a Church of <hi>England-man</hi> go all that way back again without ſeparating from the Church of <hi>England?</hi> If the Denying of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> break no Union with thoſe who Hold it; how comes, the Holding it to diſ-unite us from thoſe who Deny it? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Doctor might have ſpared his Third Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt me at this time, and firſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether the matter on which it was grounded were true, or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:41662:26"/>
But the Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>England</hi> muſt be <hi>two diſtinct Churches,</hi> when it is for the Doctors turn<hi>:</hi> And <hi>One and the ſame</hi> when a contrary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe requires it. That is, when my Apoſtacy is to be proved, they are <hi>two;</hi> and when the Doctor's Succeſſion is to be made out, they are but <hi>One.</hi> It was not without cauſe, that the Antients ſaid, <hi>Oportet mendacem eſſe Memorem,</hi> ſince it is ſo very hard, for much to be ſpoken in the Defence of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood without the ſtumbling upon ſome Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or other.</p>
               <p>It is not impoſſible, but Dr. <hi>T.</hi> may Anſwer what is added by his aboveſaid <hi>Learned</hi> Brother, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Engliſh Church is in the Church of <hi>Rome, neither as a Viſible Church altogether diſtinct from it, nor any Native Member of it.</hi> But this, (to ſay nothing of the fancifulneſs of the Notion) will not ſerve for the Doctors excuſe. For he charges me roundly to have forſaken the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whereas (according to this Learned Man) he ought to have ſaid, that I had not <hi>altogether</hi> left it, but had ſtill, at leaſt one foot in it's Communion, or ſome ſuch like Church of <hi>England-Oracle,</hi> which, like their <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> might have been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted either way. This is not trifling (tho' it may ſeem ſo at firſt ſight) but a clear Manifeſtation of what moſt naturally proceeds from the admirable <hi>Harmony</hi> of Proteſtant Doctrins.</p>
               <p>I have now done with the Doctors Preliminary Exceptions: But before I paſs to any other part of his Account, I will do him ſo much right as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that I am verily perſuaded, that he made theſe Exceptions not out of much malice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41662:26"/>
me, or for any great weight he imagined to be in them, but meerly to ſpend the time, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe the Auditors, or, it may be, to diſcompoſe his Antagoniſts, and render them leſs preſent to themſelves: Such Salutations (ordinarily ſpeaking) being but an ill tuning of the mind for calm and ſerious Diſcourſes. For (as I have already hinted) if Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> had thought it both unreaſonable and inconvenient, that I ſhould be preſent at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, why had he not accepted of that perſon, whom Mr. <hi>P.</hi> propoſed in my ſtead, or otherwiſe inſiſted on it, that I ſhould have withdrawn; which I aſſure him, had been no leſs a favor to me, than he could think it a convenience to himſelf?</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>T.</hi> ſays in the beginning of his <hi>6th. page,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> [after his ſitting down] <hi>ſpake firſt about Pen and Ink, and an</hi> Amanuenſis, <hi>but</hi> Dr. <hi>T. having brought no perſon with him, and the Crowd preſſing,</hi> Mr. <hi>P. began a Verbal Conference, by ſaying the Proteſtants had no Bible, deſiring</hi> Dr. <hi>T. to prove they had one, and asking him how, and whence they had one, and what was their Rule of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This looks, as if there had been but a ſlight mention made of having the Arguments taken in Writing, and that it was after our ſitting down, and only by Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting much for it had begun a Verbal Conference: Whereas both Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and my ſelf were very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for it, and propoſed it before our ſitting down; Nay, it was on this propoſal of ours, that the Doctor invited us to ſit down, after having firſt told us, that he had no Pen and Ink, nor Writer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> According to what I have ſaid above <hi>p.</hi> 14.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41662:27"/>
Poſſibly Mr. <hi>P.</hi> might mention this again after he ſat down, tho' I do not remember it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, after this firſt <hi>ſitting down,</hi> the Doctor added two of his Objections againſt me, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſome Preliminary things as he called them. And it was after theſe Diſcourſes (tho' they are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as trivial in Mr. <hi>P—s</hi> account) that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> began his Argumentation, and not immediately after the propoſal of having it Written (as Dr. <hi>T.</hi> ſays) for Mr. <hi>P.</hi> perceiving, that the Doctor had a mind to conſume the time in unprofitable Cavils, endeavored to cut him ſhort, by putting him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the buſineſs, for which they had met.</p>
               <p>I mention theſe particulars, that the <hi>not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of this Propoſal of <hi>Writing,</hi> may appear (what truly it was) the Doctors Tergiverſation. Had Mr. <hi>P.</hi> been then as well acquainted with Dr. <hi>T.</hi> as he is now, he would abſolutely have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the Conference, had not his deſire of <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> been yielded to. And this is the reſolution, which he has taken for the future<hi>:</hi> Which, in my judgment, is but <hi>ſhutting the Stable-door, after the Steed is Stolen:</hi> For (I believe) he is never like to have the Doctors Company on ſuch hard terms, notwithſtanding that he ſeems to offer <hi>p.</hi> 70. what he refuſed at the Conference.</p>
               <p>Whereas he ſays, Mr. <hi>P. began a Verbal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, by ſaying the Proteſtants had no Bible.</hi> It was not ſo: For, he began the Conference, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the Doctor to Aſſign his Rule of Faith: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt given us ſome account, how the Youth (for whoſe ſake the Conference was) came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain thoughts of making himſelf a Member of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41662:27"/>
the Roman Catholic Church. And to that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition (after much debate concerning theſe Deſires in the Youth) the Doctor replyed (being again and again preſſed to it by Mr. <hi>P.)</hi> that <hi>his Rule of Faith was the Holy Scripture.</hi> And it was on this Anſwer, that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> asked the Doctor, <hi>how he could prove, that the Book which he called Holy Scripture, was truly ſuch,</hi> and not before, as it is made by the Doctors Account; which (as I have complained before) is one of the moſt intricate things I ever met with, and no more like the Conference, than it is uſual for the new hands at Cards (after the Pack is well ſhuffled) to be like the former ones. The Cards, it is true, are all the ſame, but their places being changed, the Games are different. I do not ſay, that this <hi>Account</hi> is more confuſed than the Conference, but the confuſion has quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhape, or figure than it had.</p>
               <p>But the matter of Fact being cleared, as above, it becomes more evident, how much Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> diſſembled, when inſtead of proving his Bible to be true Scripture, as was deſired, he offered <hi>to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>out of that Book which Mr.</hi> P. <hi>ſhould own to be Scripture,</hi> ſince it could not but be manifeſt to him, that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> did not only ask him for the proof of thoſe places, wherein his Bible differs from ours, but for the proof of the whole, or if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a proof of ſuch places only, it was not for the ſake of any Arguments which the Proteſtants take thence for the defence of their Religion, but that it might appear on what Teſtimony they had received the Scripture, and conſequently on what grounds their Reformation had proceeded. And therefore when to avoid this proof he offered to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41662:28"/>
diſpute out of Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s Bible (which he might eaſily have done by the help of his own Interpretation) it was a plain (tho', with the Rabble, a very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) evaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Method</hi> [viz. <hi>of Diſputing out of Mr.</hi> P's <hi>Bible]</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>Mr.</hi> P. <hi>would not allow, but repeated his Diſcourſe about our not having a Bible, and our not being able if we had one, to prove we had one; and asked again about the Rule of our Faith. Dr.</hi> T. <hi>before he anſwered to this, applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Mr.</hi> M. <hi>(who ſeem'd to be the calmer perſon, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Doctor diſcovers his way of Diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. How comes the Doctor to <hi>apply himſelf to Mr.</hi> M. whereas Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had begun his Conference with him, and propoſed the main Queſtion of it? How come we not to receive an Anſwer to this Queſtion till two or three Pages full of <hi>wrangling</hi> after it was propoſed, nor then neither (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, <hi>p.</hi> 9.) till Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and Mr. <hi>M.</hi> not ſuffering him to tell a Story, preſſed him to it, nor even then (as he farther <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> owns) till he had chid Mr. <hi>P.</hi> for <hi>asking him Queſtions, and ſeeming to Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize him.</hi> Surely after ſo long an Expectation the Anſwer muſt needs be extraordinary.</p>
               <p>In the next place, how comes Mr. <hi>M.</hi> tho' a Convert, and <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>poſſeſſed with a Spirit of fiercer Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottry</hi> than other Romaniſts, to be <hi>the calmer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</hi> But Dr. <hi>T.</hi> wants an excuſe for turning away from his Antagoniſt, and ſpeaking to one who (as he was told at the beginning) was to have no part in the Diſpute. And as for the Complement, he is reſolved, that I ſhall pay dear for it, before he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41662:28"/>
parts with me. Beſides, ſome ſuch appearance of Candor (the common Artifice of Detractors) is neceſſary for the obtaining a belief to the baſeſt of Calumnies which is to <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> T. <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>put Mr.</hi> M. <hi>in mind, that ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes as theſe</hi> [concerning the proof of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture] <hi>and ſome others lately uſed by the Romaniſts about the</hi> Trinity <hi>and</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make the People Atheiſts or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, than Converts. And that the Indifferent were ready to ſay, Content: We cannot believe Tranſubſtantiation, and we will have no Trinity; We cannot have the Bible unleſs we take it upon Roman Authority, and none we will have. Mr.</hi> M. <hi>ſaid, That would not be the conſequence; but gave no reaſon why he ſaid ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>M.</hi> can give a very good reaſon, why he then gave none. It is, becauſe before he could pronounce Six words, Dr. <hi>T.</hi> turn'd back again to Mr. <hi>P.</hi> And it was not for one (as I have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated already) who looked on himſelf as wholly unconcerned in the Controverſie, to interrupt it ſo far, as to preſs the Doctor to hearken to him.</p>
               <p>What I would have then ſaid (had the Doctor been pleaſed to ſtay for it) was, That thoſe who would give themſelves leave to conſider, would find ſo good Authority in the Roman Church, for the belief of the Trinity, and the Holy Scripture, that tho' there were no other Authority for them (as indeed there is none) yet this alone would be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. And conſequently, that there would be no danger of Atheiſm, but where Obſtinacy and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs ſhould interpoſe, which would never leave
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41662:29"/>
Men deſtitute of a <hi>Pretence</hi> for Incredulity, tho' they ſhould want a <hi>juſt reaſon</hi> for it ever ſo much. I ſhould have added, that it was an excellent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Truth of a Religion, when it could be ſhewn, that either ſuch a Religion was <hi>True,</hi> or elſe that none was ſo. Wherefore if it could be proved, that on the denyal of this <hi>Roman Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> (as the Doctor calls it) Men would have no reaſon to believe a God, it muſt needs have followed, that the <hi>Roman Authority</hi> was not to be denyed.</p>
               <p>Beſides: An <hi>Arian</hi> might have upbraided the Antient Catholics after the ſame manner and ſaid, that ſo much inſiſting on the neceſſity of believing a Trinity, <hi>would rather make the People Atheiſts or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, than Converts.</hi> And that the Indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent would be ready to ſay, content: <hi>We cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the</hi> Trinity, <hi>and we will have no</hi> Deity. <hi>For</hi> Athanaſius <hi>tells us, that it will ſtand us in little ſtead to believe a God, unleſs we alſo believe (what is plainly repugnant to our Reaſon) a</hi> Trinity <hi>of perſons in an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Subſtance.</hi> And this Diſcourſe would not have been leſs concluſive in the <hi>Arians</hi> Mouth, than it was in the Doctors.</p>
               <p>This was the Anſwer, which the Doctor by the Spirit of Prophecy thought not worth the tarrying for, and therefore faced about to Mr. <hi>P.</hi> Which I ſhould not have complained of, had it been to have Anſwered Mr. <hi>P's.</hi> Queſtion.

However, what is here ſaid, may ſerve to give the Reader ſome kind of Notion of them.</p>
               <p>He ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>Mr.</hi> M. <hi>had ſome while before ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> T. <hi>(who had ſaid, that we find the Bible, which we now have, Quoted by the Antient Fathers) how he came to know they were Fathers? To which Queſtion he thought an Anſwer in that place a condeſcention to an Impertinence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctor had been asked, upon what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or Teſtimony [for the Doctor diſtinguiſhes between them] he had received his Bible. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered (amongſt other things) that <hi>he found his Bible Quoted by the Antient Fathers.</hi> Now, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the Fathers, and their works ſtood in need of ſome Teſtimony themſelves for their being relyed on. And therefore I asked the Doctor, how he knew they were Fathers? By <hi>Fathers,</hi> I ſuppoſe he meant <hi>Orthodox Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Church. Wherefore the meaning of my Queſtion was, how he could prove thoſe whom he accounted Fathers to be Orthodox? If he ſhould have ſaid, that they had been allowed to be ſuch by all Chriſtians; It would have been denyed him, there having been, and ſtill being ſeveral Societies of ſuch as Profeſs Chriſtianity who aſſert the contrary. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs the Doctor could give us a mark where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might know which ſort of Chriſtians are in the right, and which in the wrong, it would be impoſſible for us to underſtand from their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony whether the Fathers were <hi>Orthodox</hi> or not.</p>
               <p>If he ſhould have replyed, that theſe Fathers were approved by <hi>our ſelves;</hi> That alſo would
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41662:30"/>
have been as little to his purpoſe. For, if he looks on our Authority as <hi>Good,</hi> he ought to receive ſeveral other things upon it, which he does not. And if he takes it not to be <hi>ſuch,</hi> he cannot confide in it either for Scripture or Fathers. Since here, they are not Arguments <hi>ad hominem</hi> (or concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the Private difference between us and them) but general Arguments which we require of them. I mean ſuch, as may ſerve to evidence the certainty of Holy Writ to the whole World. And if the Doctor would have granted, that this could have been done by our Authority, it may eaſily be believed, that we ſhould have asked no more.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If he ſhould have ſaid, that he knew thoſe Antient Fathers to be Orthodox no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than by the Conformity which he obſerved in their Tenets to the Doctrin of the Scriptures (which is the Proteſtant way of proving the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxneſs of either particular Men or Churches) he would have involved himſelf in a Circle, by proving the Fathers to be true from their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Scriptures, and the Scriptures to be ſo from the approbation of the Fathers.</p>
               <p>By this time, I ſuppoſe, it ſufficiently appears to unbyaſs'd Readers, that Doctor <hi>Teniſon</hi> would have ſhewed his Learning more by Anſwering this Queſtion, than he has done his Manners, by calling it Impertinent.</p>
               <p>Here I cannot but take notice, that this Queſtion of mine is inſerted in a wrong place, to make People believe, that I was preſent to ſo much of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference<hi>:</hi> Whereas I am as certain, as my memory
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41662:30"/>
can make me, that I heard none of thoſe Diſcourſes from the middle of the Doctors <hi>10th.</hi> Page, till towards the latter end of his <hi>17th.</hi> When the Doctors loud Clamors about the Quotation out of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> brought me back from the Window, whither I had retired long before, <hi>viz.</hi> before the aboveſaid Diſcourſes which begin at the middle of the Tenth Page. I ſay, I was preſent to none of thoſe Diſcourſes between the middle of the Tenth, and the latter end of the <hi>17th.</hi> Page, excepting ſomewhat which is miſ-placed, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr, <hi>P</hi>'s Reprehenſion of the School-maſter for his <hi>Wry Mouths, &amp;c.</hi> which was ſoon after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Conference, and a little while before I withdrew: But the Doctor ſets it down in this <note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> place, that the People may not imagin, that the School-maſter came ſo ſoon to his Aſſiſtance, as in Truth he did. Neither was this Reprehenſion occaſioned (as the Doctor would have it) by any Diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council which was not then ſpoken to, but on the School-maſters producing a Picture in a Breviary, and (to ſhew his Wit) laughing at it. Which was an action no way pertinent to the matter then in debate. And therefore the Doctor, to diſguiſe the School-maſters intruſion, ſays nothing of the Diſcourſe, which happened about the Picture. <hi>It is unhappy</hi> (ſays the Doctor <hi>p.</hi> 65.) <hi>that amidſt ſo many things we can have nothing ſincere, and in it's Naturals.</hi> The reaſon of it is, becauſe in ſuch occaſions the Truth is ſeldom honorable for both ſides. And I queſtion not, but the Doctor is convinced by this time, that he was much in the right, when he choſe rather to truſt his own Memory, than his own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuenſis.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:41662:31"/>
Concerning what he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>viz. Mr.</hi> M. <hi>asked what Writers?</hi> I do not remember that Queſtion, neither did I hear the Diſcourſe of that Paragraph. What he ſaid alſo to me in Derogation of Mr. <hi>P.</hi> tho' he hath it, <hi>p.</hi> 15. was a long time after. But the Doctor is reſolved to ſpread my Controverſie through his whole Narrative, tho' by this means it be very thin, and neither much for my credit, nor his: It is poſſible, that the Doctor thinks to help it out, by putting my Name at length, ſo <note n="*" place="margin">Six times in two Pages.</note> often as he doth, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this famous Story, whereas the reſt of the perſons of his <hi>Drama</hi> (excepting only <hi>one,</hi> as I take it) have only the firſt Letter of Theirs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever leſt the Doctor ſhould deſign a Favor by it (tho' his not dealing ſo by his <hi>moſt worthy Friends</hi> might make one think otherwiſe) and ſince (whilſt I am contented to yield to him in Contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Abuſe) I am reſolved not to come one jot behind him in Point of Courteſie, I have deſired the Printer to pay him the ſame Reſpect, as often as he can do it conveniently: That his NAME may rumble as much in my Pamphlet, as mine doth in his. And altho' this ſhould prove to be a ſign of ill Will (for I know not what to make of it) our Spleen would not be miſ-placed upon the Doctors <hi>Name,</hi> ſince it is <hi>That</hi> which has done us Ten times more harm than his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tho' indeed ever ſince his late Book, we have ſome reaſon to hope, that it's Authority is much leſſened with all Thoſe, whoſe minds are at liberty to Conſider.</p>
               <p>There is one thing which, with my Readers
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41662:31"/>
Licence, I deſire to take notice of, before I paſs on to the remainder of the Doctors Relation, which is the groſs fallacy wherewith ſome Proteſtant Divines are wont to delude the Common People, whenſoever they are called upon by Catholics to ſhew, on what Authority they receive the Holy Scripture. <hi>The Papiſts</hi> (ſay they) <hi>queſtion the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture.</hi> Again, when it is alledged, that the Scripture left to the Interpretation of each private perſon can decide no Point of Controverſie, ſince doubtleſly every one will declare, that the Scripture is for him; and in effect he does declare it by holding his particular Tenet (whatſoever it be) as grounded on Scripture. I ſay, when this is urged; They cry, <hi>The Scripture is undervalued by the Papiſts.</hi> And this makes ſuch deep Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the unthinking Multitude (or, ſhall I ſay, ſtrikes ſuch a damp on their Spirits) that many times it ſurpaſſes the skill of the ableſt and plaineſt Logician to undeceive them. And yet it is not becauſe they <hi>cannot</hi> think Rationally enough to diſcern the Fallacy, but becauſe they <hi>will not;</hi> ſince there is no underſtanding amongſt them ſo dull or ſhort-ſighted, but if it be made uſe of, muſt ſee through it.</p>
               <p>None can have a greater reſpect for the Holy Scripture, than Catholics have. I my ſelf have known ſeveral of them beyond-Sea, who amongſt their other Devotions Reading ſome part of the Holy Scripture every day, to ſhew their profound Veneration for it, were always wont to Read it on their Knees; which whoſoever obſerves, and compares with that very indifferent behaviour, wherewith it is ordinarily handled here in <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:41662:32"/>
will not ſay that Catholics have a leſs regard for the Holy Scripture, than Proteſtants. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, they do as little queſtion it's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>Why then do the Catholics urge the Proteſtants to ſhew on what Authority or Teſtimony they receive the Bible, ſince it's Authority is undoubted on both ſides? It is, becauſe the Catholics would take this occaſion of ſhewing their Adverſaries, that of neceſſity a True and Uncorrupted Church muſt be allowed to have been in the World, when they began their pretended Reformation, <hi>viz.</hi> about a hundred and fifty years ago: For, ſince they received their Bible from ſome Church then in the World; in caſe there were at that time no true nor uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Church, it muſt follow, that they had no good Authority for their Bible. And on the contrary, if the Proteſtants will own that they received their Bible from good hands, they muſt acknowledge, that they had it from a True Church, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that there was ſuch a one in the World when they began to Reform. And from hence it will immediately follow, that the firſt Reformers ſeparating from the whole World, (as hath been ſaid) did alſo ſeparate from the True Church which (as we here ſuppoſe them to confeſs) was then in it: And therefore muſt be accounted Schiſmatics, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they can give us ſome better Definition of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> than that which hitherto we have had, <hi>viz.</hi> of it's being <hi>a Separation from the Obedience and Communion of the True Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet another Reaſon, why we ask the Proteſtants, on what Authority they receive the Scriptures. And it is, becauſe we would likewiſe put
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41662:32"/>
them in mind of what I hinted above, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ought to admit other things, and indeed, the <hi>meaning</hi> of the Scripture, upon the ſame Authority, on which they admit the <hi>letter.</hi> And therefore when they ſay, that they had the Scripture from the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, we tell them, that if the Roman Catholics may be relyed on for the reception of the Scripture, they may be credited for other Doctrins. If they are bad Witneſſes, no part of their Teſtimony can be valid. Wherefore if any part of it be ſo, they muſt be look'd on as <hi>Good</hi> Witneſſes, and conſequently their whole Teſtimony ought to be embraced. And this is another cauſe of this Queſtion.</p>
               <p>But why do the Catholics derogate ſo much from the moſt abundant Perfection of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to affirm that it is inſufficient of it ſelf to decide our Controverſies in Faith? It is, becauſe the daily and palpable experience of Mankind Teaches it to be ſo. Neither is it any derogation to a Law, to ſay, that it ſtands in need of what never yet any Law was without, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>Judge,</hi> or <hi>Interpreter</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>And I wonder, that the Proteſtants, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that every Man is fallible, and as ſuch may be miſtaken in the Senſe of Scripture, <hi>and that,</hi> to his Damnation, ſhould look on it as a Derogation to the ſame Scripture, to think that God (whoſe Mercy is over all his Works) hath appointed ſome means to keep us from being ſo miſtaken. Eſpecially when this help is not ſo much for the Scripture, as for our underſtandings. It arguing no more a defect in thoſe ſacred Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums, that our narrow Intellects are not able to comprehend their meaning without an Interpreter
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41662:33"/>
(as it fared with the <note n="*" place="margin">

And he ſaid, how can I, except ſome Man ſhould guide me? &amp;c.</hi> Act. c. 8. v. 30.31.</note> 
                  <hi>Eunuch</hi> ſpoken of in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles)</hi> than it doth a fault in a good Print, that it cannot be Read by weak Eyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of a Glaſs.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if it be a Derogation to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, that it ſtands in need of ſomewhat beſides it ſelf for it's being underſtood by us; How will thoſe Proteſtants defend themſelves, who affirm that <hi>Prayer, Humility</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Pa. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Guides</hi> are neceſſary for this purpoſe? What greater affront is it to the Scripture to declare, that it cannot be underſtood without the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, than it is to ſay, that it cannot be underſtood without Miniſterial Guides? Nor even with them (according to Proteſtants) any more than <hi>fallibly;</hi> which is, in truth, not to be underſtood at all; for, how can a Man be ſaid to know the meaning of a thing, whilſt he doubts whether he know it, or not; as all thoſe muſt do, who conſider that they are Fallible, and therefore may be Miſtaken in their Interpretations?</p>
               <p>There is alſo another ſuppoſed Irreverence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Holy Scripture, that the Catholics are accuſed of, which conſiſts in this, that they make the Tradition of the Church to be of equal credit with it. On this Point I ſhall only ask this ſhort Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it be not as much to be believed, that St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel is the word of God, which is the Tradition of the Church; as it is, that our Saviour Faſted Forty Days and Forty Nights, which is part of that Goſpel? If it be (as I preſume none will deny) then it muſt follow, that <hi>Tradition,</hi> which is the unwritten Word of God, muſt oblige us to believe, as much, as <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:41662:33"/>
which is his written Word. And, indeed who is there that can doubt but that heretofore, the Apoſtles Sermons and Verbal directions (and that which the Faithful remembred of them) were of equal Authority with their Epiſtles and other Writings? Shall we not think, that what was laid up in their Memories was as Obligatory, as that which was committed to Paper, Eſpecially whilſt we hear St. <hi>Paul</hi> Commanding the <note n="*" place="margin">2 Theſ. c. 2. v. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians</hi> to hold faſt thoſe Traditions, which they had learnt, whether it had been by <hi>word</hi> of Mouth, or by <hi>Epiſtle?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the whole matter I dare boldly affirm, that there is none, who ſhall impartially conſider what hath been ſaid here, but will perceive, that the Catholics have a greater reſpect for the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than the Proteſtants, and this, with relation both to it's <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to it's Authority [I mean, it's <hi>Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickneſs]</hi> the Catholics Declare, that it hath been handed from the time of the Apoſtles down to ours by a True and Uncorrupted Church. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Proteſtants do not allow that they received it from any Society of Chriſtians but ſuch as (according to their own ſentiments) were Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. The Inference of this, and of what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, is too plain, to need the making.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to it's Uſefulneſs. The Catholics affirm, that God hath left us ſome ſure means of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it a-right, ſo far forth as it ſhall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our Salvation, whereas the Proteſtants aſſign no other way of underſtanding the Scripture, but what they acknowledge to be Uncertain.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but take notice, that a Bible in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41662:34"/>
an unknown Tongue, which is capable of being rightly Interpreted, and is daily ſo Interpreted to the Common People, is incomparably of more uſe to them than one in the Vulgar Tongue, which can be underſtood no otherwiſe than <hi>fallibly,</hi> That is (as I have ſaid <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See above</hi> Pag. 56.</note> above) <hi>cannot be</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, indeed can be of no uſe, but rather hurtful.</note> 
                  <hi>underſtood.</hi> An unknown Tongue which may be Interpreted being certainly leſs inconvenient, than an unknown Senſe which may not be Found out.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if Scripture appear both more <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic</hi> and more <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful</hi> by Catholic Tenets, than it doth by Proteſtant, can it be thought to have leſs Reſpect amongſt us, than it has amongſt them?</p>
               <p>There is yet another plauſible Pretence which ſerves rather to Amuſe, than Argumentatively to deceive the Common People whenever this Point <hi>viz.</hi> the Teſtimony, on which Holy Scripture is to be received, comes into Debate. They ſay, <hi>that the Holy Scripture hath a ſufficient Authority from it ſelf, that it is diſcerned by it's own Light, and that it's Style, Contexture and Precepts are ſuch, as neceſſarily ſpeak it to be Divine, inſomuch that it ſtands not in any need of being recommended to us by any Extrinſic Teſtimony whatſoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly if this were ſo, the Apoſtles would have had an eaſier task in the Converſion of the World, than it proved to them. They needed only to have Tranſlated their Goſpels into the Languages of all Nations, and ſo by Ordinary Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to have diſperſed them from one end of the World to the other. And by this means, they might have been in thoſe days as ſparing of their
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41662:34"/>
Journeys, as their pretended Succeſſors of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are in theſe. And foraſmuch as concerns thoſe Miraculous Gifts, which were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them, for the propagation of the Faith, all of them had been Superfluous, excepting only that of Tongues. Their Scripture would have diſcovered it ſelf by it's own Light to be the word of God, and what was Plain in it (according to our Modern Doctrin) would be ſufficient for Salvation. But ſince this was quite otherwiſe, and that the Word of God was heretofore recommended to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by the great Labors, Holy Lives, and frequent Miracles of thoſe who Preached it, and even with all theſe helps found not that Credit with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part which it ought, we muſt conclude that this Holy word ſtands in need of ſome Extrinſic Teſtimony, ſince at the beginning it pleaſed God (who does no unneceſſary thing) to accompany it with <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>But they [the Apoſtles] go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth Preached every where, our Lord working withal, and</hi> Confirming <hi>the</hi> Word <hi>with</hi> Signs <hi>that followed,</hi> Mark c. 16. v. 20.</note> ſuch, and that even when it came from the Bleſſed Mouth of his own <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The Works that I do in the name of my Father, they give Teſtimony of me,</hi> John c. 10. v. 25. <hi>And again,</hi> ver. 38. <hi>Believe the Works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in me,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Son.</p>
               <p>And yet, tho' we ſhould grant that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſo admirable in theſe Writings, that foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as concerns the whole frame of them, it muſt neceſſarily appear (at leaſt, to a well-diſpoſed mind) that they can have no other Author than God himſelf: Will it therefore follow, that every Verſe is ſuch, every Hiſtorical paſſage, or that ſome Syllable or Word may not be added, or taken away in ſome Myſtery of Faith, without breaking
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41662:35"/>
in upon the Majeſty of the Style, or whatever elſe beſpeaks our veneration for this Book? May not (I ſay) ſomewhat of this Nature be done, which may change the Meaning of a Sentence, and yet thence no evidence ariſe that this Sentence ſo changed is not from God?</p>
               <p>For further Illuſtration and Proof of what I ſay, let us ſuppoſe that there were two Editions of the Bible, delivered to us by an Extrinſick Teſtimony or Authority ſo equal, that we could not diſcern which Teſtimony were beſt, and that in one of theſe Editions our Saviour's words in the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bleſſed Sacrament ſhould be, THIS is a Sign of my Body, and in the other (what they now are) THIS is my Body. Would it appear from the ſound, or any thing elſe, which of theſe two Sentences was ſpoken by Chriſt? I preſume that (conſidering the various opinions which are now in the World concerning this Myſtery) you are ready to ſay, that it would not. Suppoſe then, that I, or any other private perſon ſhould put forth an Edition of the Bible, which ſhould have the former Sentence, <hi>This is a Sign of my Body,</hi> inſtead of the latter, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> It is evident, indeed, that ſuch an Edition, would be of no Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. But why? Not for any defect in the ſound, or other intrinſic fault (as hath been ſhewn) but becauſe the Authority of one ſingle perſon, which recommends the firſt Sentence, cannot weigh with that of the whole World, which delivers the laſt. For could theſe two Sentences change their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic Teſtimonies, they would change their Credit alſo.</p>
               <p>Much more of this Nature might be added: But
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41662:35"/>
we need not have Recourſe to Suppoſitions for an Evidence of this Truth, which is ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by that Difference in the <hi>Tranſlations</hi> of the Scripture, which is already in the World.</p>
               <p>By Difference in Tranſlations, I mean, a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. <hi>when one Tranſlation hath Words expreſſing a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Senſe from thoſe which are in another.</hi>
                  </note> Senſe, and not in Language, as Dr. <hi>St—</hi> was pleaſed to Miſtake my meaning, in his ſecond Letter to Mr. <hi>G—.</hi> In which piece for the moſt part he Anſwers my Objections by <hi>miſtaking</hi> them. And certainly Books may be Anſwered with eaſe, when Ignorance it ſelf (as <hi>Miſtaking</hi> is) either Real or Pretended, is able to do the work. The prevention of ſuch <hi>miſtakes</hi> was one of the Reaſons, why I preferr'd Perſonal Conferences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Writing</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>ooks, tho, indeed, for the ſecuring ſuch Conferences from ſuch after miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, as we have here, I thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that what was ſaid in them ſhould be committed to Writing immediately upon the place.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, that this Difference of Senſe in the ſeveral Tranſlations of the Bible which are now in Being, is an undenyable proof, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does not manifeſt it ſelf to us by it's own Luſtre (as is pretended) <hi>at leaſt</hi> in all it's parts: For ſince all theſe Differences of Senſe, expreſſed by Different words, are held for Authentic, by Different Bodies of Chriſtians, whereas at moſt, there can be but one of theſe <hi>Different Expreſſions,</hi> Genuine, or True; it muſt follow, that the Truth of every parcel of Scripture is not evident to All a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and conſequently not Evident from it ſelf.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41662:36"/>
And indeed, to ſay the truth, I never knew that any ſort of Chriſtians endeavored to juſtifie the preference of their own Verſion before that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the Sound or Texture of the Expreſſions, but always from it's Conformity to the Original Languages, Antient Copies, or the like, which they would not have done, could the bare Sound, or Frame have ſufficiently pleaded for it.</p>
               <p>What is here proved from the <hi>Difference</hi> in the Tranſlations of the Bible, may be yet farther evinced by that which there is in the number of the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Books; ſince if the Scripture were evident of it ſelf, how come whole Books to be received by ſome, and rejected by others? [And here a new Reaſon offers it ſelf to me, why Proteſtants ſhould be asked more particularly, what Teſtimony they have for their Bible, ſince they lay aſide ſo much of that Canon which was confirmed by the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in the year 397. (ſubſcribed to by St. <hi>Auguſtin)</hi> as alſo by the ſixth General Council, <hi>A. D.</hi> 680. and hath been ſo generally in uſe ever ſince, for want (as they pretend) of that Teſtimony which is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>I ſhould deſign an endleſs piece of work, ſhould I purpoſe to ſet down all the abſurdities which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily are derived from this Aſſertion <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scripture is Proved by it ſelf. <hi>Dato uno ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdo, mille ſequuntur.</hi> I hope, what I have ſaid, is enough for the rejecting a Poſition, which ought rather to be eſteemed it's own diſ-proof, than the Scripture can be look'd on as it's own Proof: For ſince it is moſt apparent, that the Senſe of all the parts of Holy Scripture is not Plain to us by it's own
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41662:36"/>
Light; how comes it to paſs, that without further help we may know the Words which we Read, to be the Words of the Holy Ghoſt, and not know the Senſe, which we have of them, to be the Senſe intended by the ſame Holy Ghoſt: The Senſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which immediately is from God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the words are from Men; At leaſt, in ſuch Tranſlations as are not made by Divine Revelation or Inſpiration; Which, as I take it, the Reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not pretend to? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot think, that any one will ſay, that the Phraſe, or Form of Words in any place of Scripture is ſuch, as manifeſtly ſhews it ſelf to be from God, and yet that at the ſame time he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant whether the Senſe, which he conceives of thoſe Words, be from God, or from himſelf.</p>
               <p>It follows from theſe Conſiderations, That Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture how Sacred and Divine ſoever it be, is not <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to us by it's own light,</hi> and, conſequently, it is neither impertinent in it ſelf, nor derogatory to the Scripture, to ask, upon what Extrinſic Teſtimony it is received and acknowledged for Such.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to add one word by way of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary to what hath been ſaid, which is, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Scriptures are not made Evident by themſelves, and that no Prudent Man can receive any thing upon the credit of Falſe and Corrupted Witneſſes, it muſt be inferred, that the Proteſtant Reformers ought to quit their pretence of <hi>being Guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Scripture,</hi> ſince they have no other Rule of knowing what is ſuch, and what not, but the bare Letter of that which is called ſo, and the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41662:37"/>
of thoſe, whom they accounted to have ſo much Corruption and Falſneſs, that they ſeparated from them, without the leaſt apprehenſion of the Guilt of Schiſm. For, ſeparating from the whole World (as hath been ſaid) they muſt needs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from thoſe, upon whoſe Authority or Teſtimony they received their Bible. And this in effect was the ſumm of Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Dr. <hi>T.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould not have inſiſted ſo tediouſly on the foregoing points, had I not known that how fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous ſoever thoſe pretences (of <hi>our vilifying Scripture, looking on it as Inſufficient,</hi> and the like) may ſeem to any thinking Man, yet the common People are moſt groſly, and almoſt incurably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by them. And <hi>we are</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1. v. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Debtors both to the Wiſe and to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwiſe.</hi> And foraſmuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns this laſt Point, which I have ſpoken to, <hi>viz.</hi> the pretended <hi>ſelf-evidence of the Scripture,</hi> it hath dropt in my hearing not only from the Mouths of the middle ſort, but even from thoſe of the <hi>Learned World.</hi> And even Dr. <hi>T.</hi> himſelf glances at it in his Tenth Page: Nothing being more Neceſſitous, or putting a Man upon worſe ſhifts, than an ill Cauſe.</p>
               <p>But, tho' I have been very long on this ſubject, yet I cannot but make one Obſervation more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed to another, which is, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, when they find themſelves deſtitute of ſolid Proof (as in truth, they always do) for the Support of their peculiar Tenets, are wont to heap a great many Unconcluding things together,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41662:37"/>
that ſo (if poſſible) what is wanting in Strength may be made out by Number: Which however like Cyphers, tho' making as great or greater ſhew than Figures, amount to no ſumm. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample (to inſtance in the matter of our preſent Conſideration) when we ask them, how they prove their Bible, They tell us, <hi>by it's own light,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Pag. 9. and 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Their interior Senſe,</hi> and <hi>by the Teſtimony of</hi> Jews, Turks, Infidels, <hi>and laſtly of whole Bodies of</hi> Erroneous <hi>and</hi> Corrupted <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. <hi>Such Chriſtians as are accounted Erroneous and Corrupted by them.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> whereas the Catholics have but one poor Teſtimony to oppoſe to all theſe, <hi>viz. That of a true, uncorrupted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, it is not every ordinary Head which (at leaſt without ſettling) will ſerve for a juſt Ballance to theſe two Proofs, and not be weighed down by that which is moſt Bulky, tho' leaſt Weighty. And yet one would think, that it were impoſſible, but that rational Creatures ſhould ſee the plain Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the former, and the moſt abundant Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the latter.</p>
               <p>But to return to my buſineſs: Dr. <hi>T.</hi> ſays in the latter end of his <hi>17th.</hi> Page, That <hi>Mr.</hi> M. <hi>took Pen, and Dr.</hi> T. <hi>delivering him the Paper he had ſigned in order to a regular proceeding, he began to Write the firſt words of theſe Queſtions;</hi> Whether God Almighty has left us any Guide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth of the matter of Fact is this, Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> having after much time ſpent in vain (if that may be ſaid to be ſo which was <hi>ſpent</hi> as was moſt for the Doctors purpoſe) drawn Mr. <hi>P.</hi> from that point which he had deſigned for the ſubject of the whole Conference, <hi>viz. The Rule</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:41662:38"/>
                  <hi>of Faith,</hi> and fallen into particular matters, where there is much more Sea-room for Controverſie, and conſequently leſs danger of being run a-ground, whilſt theſe things were under debate, Mr. <hi>P.</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to produce ſome proofs out of the Fathers in favor of Tranſubſtantiation, and particularly quoting a paſſage out of St. <hi>Ambroſe de Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> for one, The Doctor (to uſe his own words) <hi>catch'd</hi> at it, crying out, that the Book was <hi>Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and none of St. <hi>Ambroſe's.</hi> And in this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port called for Pen, Ink and Paper. And (to ſhew what a willing Mind may do) that, which was ſo hard to come by, when the Writing of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was propoſed, was brought him in a trice. He writes down his Doughty Challenge: Which was to this purpoſe, <hi>That the Book cited by Mr.</hi> P. <hi>was Spurious and a late Book, and none of St.</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe's, <hi>and that he [Dr.</hi> Thomas Teniſon] <hi>would ſhew it to be ſuch.</hi> This he valiantly ſubſcribed. Now, indeed, according to due Form Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſhould have underwritten, <hi>That he would not fail to meet this bold Challenger, deſiring only a fair Stage, and of him no favor.</hi> But this, it ſeems, he refuſed for thoſe reaſons which he has already <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Mr.</hi> P<hi>'s Account,</hi> p. 10. <hi>and ſequ.</hi>
                  </note> Publiſhed.</p>
               <p>Now all this was done with ſo much noiſe and Triumph on the Doctors part, and with ſuch Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous applauſe of his Adherents, that (being over and above called upon by them with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity) I thought it convenient to put my ſelf into the midſt of the Buſtle, that I might come to know the matter, and keep the Peace if it ſhould lie in my Power.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I underſtood what had been the cauſe of ſo much Tumult, I immediately applyed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41662:38"/>
my ſelf to the Doctor (who had made ſome kind of Appeal to me) and told him, <hi>That indeed I could not but look on it as a very diſingenuous proceeding, that he ſhould importune Mr.</hi> P. <hi>to Subſcribe to One ſingle Quotation, as if that had been the Only thing that in ſo many hours he had been able to produce for the defence of his Religion: Which would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very Ridiculous (whether the Book could be proved Authentic, or not) to any Wiſe Man of either Church.</hi> I added, <hi>That the Doctor ſhould permit Mr.</hi> P. <hi>to do what he had deſired,</hi> viz. <hi>Write down all his Quotations and Arguments and Sign to them (which would look like</hi> ſomething) <hi>and that then the Doctor ſhould do his Beſt. And,</hi> laſtly, <hi>that this was no more, than what was Fair and Reaſonable.</hi> The Doctor having little regard to what was ſaid either by Mr. <hi>P.</hi> or my ſelf, ſtill preſſed Mr. <hi>P.</hi> to ſubſcribe.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>P.</hi> not being drawn by the Doctors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated inſtances, nor by the <hi>Importunity of his</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 70. <hi>and in Mr.</hi> P's <hi>Acc.</hi> pa. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Ingenious Women,</hi> to what he judged neither Prudent nor Equitable, I took the Pen into my hand, and taking the Paper from Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi>'s, I told him, that I would Write ſomething, which ſhould look more like the ſubſtance of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, than what he had Written, and in it ſelf be more Efficacious towards the ending of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. What I would have ſet down, was as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether God Almighty hath left us any Guide or Guides to direct us in the Interpretation of Scripture in things neceſſary to Salvation?</hi> [Or]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whether he hath left every one to his own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in ſuch Interpretation, without obliging</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:41662:39"/>
                  <hi>him to</hi> ſubmit his Judgment <hi>to any other?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I had ſcarce Written the three firſt Words of theſe Queſtions, before the Doctor ſnatches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Paper, and blots out my Writing (as much as he could) with his Fingers. Which was, as I ſuppoſe, leſt <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 70.</note> 
                  <hi>ſome weight might be laid upon Ones Writing and Signing, and the others Refuſing.</hi> For this <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. <hi>Dr.</hi> T's <hi>Writing and Signing, and Mr.</hi> P's <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to Sign.</hi>
                  </note> was to be the Sign of Dr. <hi>Teniſons</hi> carrying the day. And if I had Written, and the Doctor had refuſed to Sign (as it was Ten to one but he would) all had been ſpoiled, and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had been but a drawn Battel at beſt.</p>
               <p>Now I muſt confeſs, that there was no great <hi>weight,</hi> to be laid upon my <hi>three Words,</hi> eſpecially after the Doctor had blotted them. But certainly the Doctors <hi>not giving leave to Write</hi> will bear as much <hi>Weight,</hi> as Mr. <hi>P's refuſing to Sign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Dr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaid, that <hi>I was drawing them away from their Point.</hi> I know not how far it drew them from their Point: But I am ſure it drew them back to that <hi>Point</hi> which was propoſed for the Subject of their Conference, and which they ought to have been upon, <hi>viz. The Rule of Faith:</hi> And which, had it been once fixt, would have ſettled even that Point which they had then ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to. Wherefore (as I have ſaid already) I told the Doctor that I would propoſe ſomewhat, that might be look'd on as the ſubſtance of the Conference with more juſtice, than what he had Written. And as he had taken the liberty to pick out of this Conference what pleaſed him beſt for <hi>Writing,</hi> ſo he ought to have permitted us to make choice of that which we had a mind to, for the like purpoſe. Eſpecially when in Truth the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41662:39"/>
Queſtion which Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had propoſed and Mine were of the ſame nature, and the Doctor by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One would have Anſwered Both; Or, indeed when my Queſtion was but the ſecond Branch of Mr. <hi>P's.</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ask'd from whom we were to receive the Scriptures. My Queſtion was from whom we were to have the Meaning of them. Now St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> will tell you, that you ought to receive the Senſe or meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from thoſe, on whoſe Teſtimony you admit the Letter [according to a <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> contra<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Epiſt. Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</note> paſſage which I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Quoted to Dr. <hi>St—.</hi> And which he (not liking, as I ſuppoſe, St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> Judgment) took no notice of.] Wherefore, (according to the Senſe of this Father) if Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> had found out thoſe Chriſtians, on whom he might have relyed for the receiving of the Scriptures, which was Mr. <hi>P's.</hi> Queſtion; he would have known whom to have truſted for the underſtanding them, which was Mine.</p>
               <p>Which being ſo, I leave my Readers to Judge, whether either of theſe Queſtions were not much more to the purpoſe, than that which the Dr. ſet up.</p>
               <p>Indeed, it was ſo little to our Controverſie, whether that Book were truly St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s or not, that I wonder, that a grave Man ſhould forget himſelf ſo much, as to lay any ſtreſs on it, when other Proofs were offered full as plain, and out of Writers of as great Authority as St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and even, when there is a paſſage to the ſame purpoſe, and (to a great degree) in the ſame words, in an undoubted Work of St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> Nay, one of the Arguments which is brought againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Book <hi>De Sacramentis,</hi> is that the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41662:40"/>
words of this Quotation are in another Work of the ſame St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and that it is improbable, this Author would uſe the ſame Words and Phraſes in two diſtinct Books. Which, if a good Argument againſt the Authority of that Book, is likewiſe a very good one for the Authority of the Paſſage. Wherefore if that paſſage which was alledged, or one Equivalent to it were undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s, of what moment could it be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that particular Book which was firſt named, were St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s or not? If the paſſage prove what it was produced for, it is (at leaſt Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently) in an undoubted work of St. <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> And if it prove nothing, why ſo much clutter, whether the Book be Authentic or not?</p>
               <p>Here the Reader may be put in mind of another Method, which the Proteſtants uſe in their Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. When the Work of any Father is Quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Catholics, if it were ever doubted of, there is no remedy but it muſt paſs for Spurious. And when it ſhall happen to be Undoubted, they will do as much as in them lies to render it Dubious, <hi>at leaſt</hi> in thoſe places which are Quoted. But when nothing of this will do, their laſt ſhift is <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> which, indeed, does their buſineſs effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Interpretation</hi> is laid up like a Treaſure, which is never to be brought forth but in caſes of urgent neceſſity. Otherwiſe they would need no other Fond for the carrying on of almoſt all their Controverſial Expeditions. For, what need is there, that they ſhould ſpoil their Eyes with por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on old Worm-eaten Manuſcripts, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of an Author, when perhaps the paſſage
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41662:40"/>
which they would evade, is not half ſo plain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as that of ſome unqueſtioned Book, which already they have ſet aſide by their <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?</hi> What Obligation is there, that Words in a Spurious Work ſhould have quite another Senſe, than the ſelf-ſame words in one which is Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate? No, but this knack of <hi>Interpreting</hi> is too great a cheat to be often Practiſed, and therefore, when any thing elſe will ſerve the turn, this muſt not appear.</p>
               <p>I ſaid, that Interpretation was their laſt ſhift. But (unleſs this be underſtood with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction) I think, I was too haſty in my Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Their <hi>ſhifts</hi> are like the Priviledges of ſome Parliaments not ſo. eaſie to be numbred. For ſometimes when the Author is unqueſtioned, the paſſage too palpably plain to be wreſted, and the Party ſomewhat more indifferent, and not ſo greedy of being impos'd on, and when, for theſe reaſons, the <hi>Gordian-knot</hi> cannot be untyed, what ſhould they do but follow <hi>Alexanders</hi> example? They lop off a Century or two out of the Five Hundred Years which their Brethren are wont to Appeal to; and it is great odds, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is Quoted (moſt of them, and thoſe the moſt Celebrated being in the fourth and fifth Centuries) drops with them, and loſes his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not out of any particular picque that they have againſt this Father whoever he be, but becauſe he lived in ill times, and when Popiſh Errors began to be predominant. But if it ſhall ſo happen, that they do not ſee him lying on the ground, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theſe Two Hundred Years, the third Century is ſure to follow, and then it is a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41662:41"/>
to one but they have him down. However, if after all this he ſhall yet remain untoucht: Perhaps another Branch may fall (for theſe Errors were very <hi>early</hi> in the Church) or elſe the Fathers are <hi>ſicut caeteri Homines,</hi> and (as Dr. <hi>T.</hi> intimates, <hi>p.</hi> 16.) there is no Deciſive Determination to be built on what they ſay. <hi>This</hi> you will ſay, as I have ſaid <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See above</hi> pa. 27.</note> before, <hi>agrees not well with an Appeal to the firſt Five Hundred Years.</hi> However, this <hi>gradual</hi> Proceeding argues great Moderation (a thing that is ſometimes bragg'd of) and ſhews, that the Members of this Church are not for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying matters to Extremities, but where Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity (which hath no Law) obliges them.</p>
               <p>I intimated above, that it was ten to one, but Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> would have refuſed to Write or Sign any Anſwer to my Queſtions. Which was no groundleſs Conjecture of my own. For, had he not differed from himſelf he would moſt certainly have done ſo. A Gentleman of my acquaintance (then a Proteſtant) had formerly carried him theſe Queſtions, and deſir'd his Anſwer to them in Writing. In the firſt place the Doctor took a very ſufficient time for conſideration. And in the ſecond, he abſolutely refuſed to give any thing under his hand, ſaying in excuſe, that <hi>he knew not what Inference might be made.</hi> Whereupon (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) I adviſed the Gentleman to put him in mind at their next meeting of the Logical Maxim, <hi>A</hi> veris <hi>poſſunt nil niſi</hi> vera <hi>ſequi,</hi> telling him (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently) that if his Anſwer were true, he need not fear, that any thing ſhould follow from it but Truth.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I am not ignorant, that there

is ſomething in the Doctors Narrative, which is a kind of <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> Anſwer to my Queſtions. But (as the Reader will perceive) it is not offered by the Doctor as his Anſwer to them, neither is there any thing elſe ſet forth as ſuch throughout his whole Pamplet, ſave only the mention of two Books, <hi>pag.</hi> 56. and a little one (which perhaps might be one of them) that Mrs. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.</hi> had from him, <hi>pag.</hi> 24. I ſay, there is nothing elſe but theſe Books which is propoſed by Dr. <hi>T.</hi> as an Anſwer to thoſe Queſtions.</p>
               <p>Now, for my own part, I muſt confeſs, that oftentimes, I think it much eaſier to return a Book to a Queſtion, than an Anſwer. My meaning is, that when a Difficulty pinches, it is much <hi>eaſier</hi> by long and Crafty Circumlocutions to Deceive, than by a ſhort and plain Anſwer to Satisfie. The firſt may be done by Books; but it is only Brevity and Plainneſs which can appear well in a Perſonal Conference. Wherefore, to appeal from ſuch a Conference to Books is moſt commonly to <hi>love Darkneſs rather than Light,</hi> and by entring into a Labyrinth of Words, rather to loſe an Objection, than to ſolve it.</p>
               <p>It hath happened to me ſeveral times, that when I have offered any Difficult Point to ſome Diſputants, they have told me for Anſwer, <hi>That the matter was handled in ſuch a Book, and that there I ſhould find my ſatisfaction.</hi> I have replyed, that the Difficulty lay within a narrow Compaſs, that the Solution needed not to be very long, that therefore I deſired, they would tell me, what the Book ſaid of it. All the Anſwer I could have, was <hi>That they had forgotten the Particulars; that the</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:41662:42"/>
                  <hi>Book ſatisfied them, when they Read; and they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that it would have the ſame effect on me.</hi> Which I have taken for an evident Sign, that they had been Deluded, and not Inſtructed by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Since had they met with a conciſe and ſolid proof, inſtead of a protracted and noiſie Fallacy, it would have been hardly poſſible for them not to have born it away, eſpecially when they had neither ill Wits, nor ill Memories.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, I take leave to diſſent from the Doctor, where he looks on it, as a piece of <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 56.</note> 
                  <hi>ill breeding,</hi> to ask Queſtions in a Conference, which [as he thinks] are already Anſwered in Books. Since, there being ſcarce any Point which is not ſpoken to in Books, a Conference for the moſt part is nothing elſe, but a tryal (as far as it may be) whether the Books have ſaid right or not: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to refer us to <hi>them</hi> for <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Certainly that Cauſe which the Dr. referred to</hi> 10000 <hi>pounds worth of Books was as ſafe, as the Felon would have been, had his requeſt been granted of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tryed by the</hi> 12 <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </note> Anſwers, is to ſend us thither, from whence we have Appealed. And could the <hi>Titles of Books</hi> paſs for <hi>Arguments</hi> in theſe Conferences, a Bookſellers Apprentice would <hi>out-argue</hi> Dr. <hi>Teniſon,</hi> unleſs it be, that the late care he hath had of a <hi>Library</hi> may have greatly qualified him for this kind of Diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, it is a ſhrew'd Argument with me, that this Doctor was ſomewhat Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the Truth, of what I have ſaid here, touching that room which there is for Fallacies in Books of Controverſie, ſince notwithſtanding he was ſo well prepared for the Anſwering my Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he had <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 56.</note> Written on the ſame Subject, and ſince he <hi>catch'd</hi> at all occaſions of ſhewing his Superiority over us, he yet boggled ſo much
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41662:42"/>
to give us his Anſwer upon the place; and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion choſe rather to turn us over to a Book. Which in the Doctors Judgment muſt ſtop every ones mouth who doth not think it worth his while to Anſwer it in Print. And yet the Doctor ought to be mindful of his own proceeding, ſo far as to give us leave to be ſilent, where we think an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <hi>a</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pa. 14. <hi>and</hi> 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Condeſcention to an Impertinence.</hi> But, <hi>it is not the Doctors way,</hi> to reflect, ſo much as this comes to, on what he doth himſelf. For had it been ſo, it is probable, he would not have laid any Weight on Mr. <hi>P's.</hi> Refuſing to Sign his Paper (a thing unreaſonable it ſelf) when he conſidered, not only, that at this very time he hindred us from Writing, as hath been ſhewn, but alſo that at the beginning of the Conference he made a moſt frivolous excuſe from Having the <hi>whole</hi> Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Which Refuſal, if compared with Mr. <hi>P's.</hi> was at leaſt a Mill-Stone to a Feather. Were it eaſie for us to ſee our own faults, one would think, that here were a <hi>Speculum</hi> that would help the Doctor to ſuch a ſight. However, in our preſent caſe, I am affraid, he is not ſo defective in his own ſight, as he is careful to provide duſt for the Eyes of others.</p>
               <p>This Storm about the Quotation out of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> laſted a great while, and with ſo much Commotion, that I will not undertake to deſcribe it. Amongſt the reſt of the noiſe, the Doctor cryed often, that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had <hi>Falſiſied</hi> and was a <hi>Falſiſier.</hi> Whereupon I ventured to tell him, <hi>that</hi> really, <hi>he was too ſevere in his Cenſures:</hi> For tho' it ſhould happen, that the Book Cited by Mr. <hi>P.</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:41662:43"/>
could not be proved to be St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s, yet he knew well enough, that it had been always Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under his Name, and ranked among his Works. Which circumſtances might lead a Man into this Error without the Guilt of being a Falſifier. Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> ſeem'd to yield to this, and to be willing to compound the buſineſs, and reſt ſatisfied, ſo that, at leaſt Mr. <hi>P.</hi> might paſs for an Ignorant Perſon. The Cauſe now being quite out of Doors, and the Diſpute (as the Doctor had managed the matter) growing meerly perſonal, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, nothing to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Doctors new terms of Reconciliation ſeemed yet too hard<hi>:</hi> For why ſhould Mr. <hi>P.</hi> be reputed Ignorant for Quoting an Author, which had been doubted of, unleſs he were convinced of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of that doubt by thoſe Arguments which were offer'd for it; which he was not, nor (poſſibly) ought to be? Tho' on the other ſide (as hath been intimated) it would have been an imprudence in him to have Sign'd this ſingle Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as if he had nothing elſe to produce on the behalf of his Cauſe, eſpecially when we have to deal with Men whoſe Intereſt, Prejudice or Paſſion ſtrongly inclines them to <hi>Believe</hi> againſt us. And <hi>facilè credunt, quod volunt.</hi> But I was ſo far from having an opportunity of urging this latter part of my Mediation, that I ought to be very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the room, I had, of reſcuing Mr. <hi>P.</hi> from the Doctors firſt Imputation of a <hi>Falſifier.</hi> Such a Permiſſion of ſpeech being (as I muſt aſſure you) a very great favor at our Conference.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> in his <hi>18th.</hi> Page ſays, <hi>Mr.</hi> M. <hi>and</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:41662:43"/>
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> T. <hi>talk'd a little while about a Guide in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</hi> It was, indeed, a <hi>little while.</hi> For, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding towards the latter end of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference I attempted three or four times to have ſpoken ſomething on that ſubject (which I look'd upon as the moſt important one, or rather, as I have ſaid, the only one of all Controverſie:) all my endeavors were defeated, the Doctor ſtill, by turning off the Diſcourſe, either not Anſwering to my Queſtions, as not ſuffering me to Reply to his Anſwer, Excepting only ſome few Words, which for haſte, I was forced (as the Doctor well expreſſes it) to <hi>mutter</hi> out when I took my leave.</p>
               <p>Now ſince, Dr. <hi>T.</hi> ſets down, what he told me <hi>in ſhort,</hi> concerning a Guide in Controverſie, viz. <hi>That a Man after uſing all Chriſtian means, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>the help of all Miniſterial Guides poſſible, muſt at laſt judge for himſelf, and that this was not to run on his own head: As alſo, that their People, could know the Voice of their Church, it being in their own Language, but not ſo readily the Voice of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>it being in an unknown Tongue; for the true Interpretation of which, the unlearned depend upon the particular Prieſt, that inſtructed them.</hi> I ſay, ſince the Doctor Publiſhes what he ſaid to me on this ſubject he ought to have added what I replyed to him, tho' likewiſe it were but very ſhort for the Reaſons already given. My Talk was to this purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That if Men, after the uſe of thoſe <hi>Chriſtian means, and Miniſterial Guides</hi> he ſpoke of, were by Gods appointment to follow their own Underſtandings, Thoſe Laws muſt needs be unjuſt, which puniſhed them for doing ſo. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41662:44"/>
what could the Engliſh <hi>Penal Laws</hi> have to ſay for themſelves, which did not enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men had uſed <hi>Chriſtian Means,</hi> and <hi>Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Guides,</hi> or not, but puniſhed them for follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own Underſtandings, altho' they ſhould have uſed ever ſo many <hi>Chriſtian means, &amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand? Neither do Men ſuffer by theſe Laws, only for Doctrins relating to the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as perhaps the Doctor would inſinuate by what <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> follows) but for Points meerly Religious, ſuch as are <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints, not going to a Proteſtant Church, &amp;c.</hi> For all which Points they are puniſhed; and this (to make the caſe yet harder) by ſuch Men, as owning themſelves Fallible, muſt likewiſe own, that thoſe Opinions for which they puniſh, may be Truths, and Thoſe, which they would compel us to embrace, Errors, for ought they know.</p>
               <p>This Subject is ſo plain and obvious in it's own Nature, and there hath been ſo much ſaid on it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that I ſhall only add one word by way of of a Recapitulation, which is, That on the one ſide we have the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Teaching us <hi>to Judge for our ſelves in Religious Matters,</hi> and on the other <hi>Hanging us for following her Doctrin.</hi> If we are to be our own Judges, why are we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd for it? And if not, why are we Taught to be ſo? Moſt Religions have their Myſteries, and therefore this may be allowed to the Proteſtants. But for my part, I can ſooner admit, <hi>that God is able to do more than I am able to underſtand,</hi> in the Belief of Tranſubſtantiation, than that Men can at once have a juſt ground for the <hi>Approbation</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> of the ſelf-ſame Proceeding. It being
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41662:44"/>
eaſier to diſ-believe our Senſes when our Creator Commands, than to forego our Reaſon, when we have no higher Motive for it, than the Will of our Fellow-Creatures.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, that my Diſcourſe on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at the Conference, was not ſo large, as it is here, by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of thoſe Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutory ſpaces that were allowed us by the Doctor, which ſeemed to be deſigned by him, not ſo much for our Speaking, as for his own Breathing, ſo that I was forced to cramp what I had to ſay into a few conciſe and general Propoſitions, and to throw them out, before the Doctor was aware of them. Viz. <hi>That in caſe we were not bound by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to ſubmit our Judgment to any</hi> others, <hi>but (preſuppoſing the uſe of the Doctors</hi> Chriſtian means) <hi>were left to the</hi> Guidance <hi>of our own</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, <hi>in matters of Faith; we ought not to be hindred from, or (which is the ſame thing) puniſhed for Taking it for</hi> our Guide <hi>in ſuch matters. That the</hi> Penal Laws <hi>Puniſhed us for ſo doing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were unjuſt:</hi> And the like. Which Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, tho' too brief perhaps for their being thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oughly Comprehended by the Rabble of our Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, were yet ſufficient to let the Doctor know what I meant, and conſequently for a larger Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, than what we have from him, <hi>pa.</hi> 24. Viz. <hi>Mr.</hi> M. <hi>took leave, and juſt at the Door Muttered ſomething about</hi> Penal Laws. In which (as the Reader will have found) there is no Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation either of the nature, or of the occaſion of that Diſcourſe: The matter being ſo obſcurely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, that a Proteſtant Gentleman of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance was ſo far deceived by the Doctors
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41662:45"/>
Terms, that he imagined, that <hi>I had riſen up in a heat, and threatned ſomething as I went away.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the future, when Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> ſhall tell us, That he thinks it will <hi>give the greater ſatisfaction to tell the whole Truth,—</hi>That <hi>Truth is beſt Painted at full length,—</hi>and that <hi>he will let the World know, the whole Truth, ſo far as his Memory with all due helps will ſerve him,</hi> as he doth, <hi>pag.</hi> 45. 46, <hi>and</hi> 50. We will be ſo civil to him, as not to underſtand him in a Literal Senſe.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>T.</hi> ſays in the place above cited, that we are to have <hi>the help of all Miniſterial Guides poſſible,</hi> before we <hi>muſt</hi> Judge for our ſelves. Now, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that by <hi>all Miniſterial Guides poſſible,</hi> the Doctor does not mean, all ſorts of Guides <hi>True</hi> or <hi>Falſe. Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> hinder us from converſing with thoſe of other Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe our Saviour himſelf Commands us to <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. c. 7. v. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>beware of falſe Prophets.</hi> Wherefore I would fain know, what mark the Doctor hath to diſtinguiſh ſuch Miniſterial Guides as may be Addreſſed to, from ſuch as may not. If he ſay, that we ſhall know theſe Guides by <hi>the purity of their Doctrin,</hi> [the only Mark com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly aſſigned by Proteſtants, as was intimated above, for That of the True Church.] Then it muſt follow, that I muſt firſt Judge what Doctrin is Pure, before I can know what Guides to have recourſe to, and conſequently I muſt Judge for my ſelf [in the particular <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. <hi>In the Interpretation of the Scripture.</hi>
                  </note> Doctrins of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity] before I uſe the help of theſe Miniſterial Guides. Which according to the Doctor is not to be done. The Circle in other Terms, and more
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41662:45"/>
conciſely is thus. We cannot know what Doctrin is Pure without Guides: And we cannot know what Guides to conſult without firſt knowing what Doctrin is Pure. If he ſhall Name Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, Univerſality, or any thing elſe for the mark of theſe <hi>Guides,</hi> then we will conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther That which is aſſigned, belong to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or not.</p>
               <p>The Doctor ſeems to ſay in the cloſe of his <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 18.</note> Anſwer (which as the Reader will perceive was nothing leſs than one of his uſual Digreſſions from the Point in hand) <hi>That their People knew the Voice of their Church, and needed not to depend upon the Learning of any Particular Prieſt for it.</hi> If ſo: How could the Doctor blame this Apprentice (as he doth in his <hi>55th.</hi> Page,) for not coming to him with his doubts? Would he have him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to a <hi>particular Prieſt</hi> for Inſtruction, whileſt he Heard and Knew the voice of their Church, and therefore (according to the Doctors own aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion) needed it not?</p>
               <p>But, perhaps, the Doctor will ſay, that for the Verbal Tranſlation of the Scripture the Proteſtants are not neceſſitated to have recourſe to particular Men, the Bible being Tranſlated to their hands, and warranted by public Authority (tho' here too they will be at a loſs, unleſs it appear to them, that they may confide in this <hi>Authority)</hi> but for the Senſe in all dubious places they ought to Addreſs themſelves to their Miniſters. They may do it if they pleaſe<hi>:</hi> And if not (I ſuppoſe) they may let it alone; and this laſt, with moſt ſafety<hi>:</hi> For, according to our late Divines, <hi>all things neceſſary</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:41662:46"/>
                  <hi>to Salvation are plain in Scripture,</hi> and therefore to look after the meaning of <hi>dubious places</hi> is to <hi>do more, than of bounden Duty is required,</hi> and has the appearance of <hi>a Work of Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is ſuch an abominable thing with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that they have a whole <note n="*" place="margin">See 14th. Article.</note> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle againſt it, and declare that it <hi>cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety,</hi> much leſs (as I ſuppoſe) PRACTISED. Wherefore as yet, there appears no cauſe, why the Apprentice ſhould be chidden for not having waited on Dr. <hi>T.</hi> in this occaſion. And indeed, if that be the caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are to go to their Miniſters for the Conſtruction of theſe <hi>dubious places,</hi> I do not perceive, that they have any great advantage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho' what the Doctor ſays were true, viz. <hi>That Roman Catholics were to apply themſelves to particular Prieſts for the Tranſlation of the Scriptures,</hi> ſince the Proteſtants themſelves muſt make the ſame application for the Senſe and Meaning of theſe Scriptures. And this <hi>Senſe</hi> is that which is of the greateſt importance, or rather That which is of any Importance at all.</p>
               <p>But in Truth they are not particular Prieſts which Catholics depend on for either the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Senſe of the Scripture in any neceſſary Point of Faith, but it is on their Church, whoſe Voice is as Intelligible <hi>at leaſt,</hi> and (with the Doctors leave) much farther Heard than that of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For is it not full as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in <hi>England,</hi> and much more <hi>evident</hi> in other Parts of the World, that the Church of <hi>Rome Teaches a Purgatory,</hi> than it is, that the Church of <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:41662:46"/>
                  <hi>Teaches the contrary?</hi> And ſo of other Doctrins.</p>
               <p>This is an Age, wherein Men, whileſt they Scepticize on evident Truths, are Poſitive in Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, and therefore there want not Thoſe, who ask, <hi>how the Members of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>can know what their Church holds.</hi> But when they ſhall have conſidered, how they themſelves come to know what That Church holds, whileſt they Condemn it's Doctrins, as alſo how a Man may come to underſtand what is held by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they will not (I ſuppoſe) expect any farther Anſwer. This were it not ſo Common (and even with Men of no <hi>Common</hi> Wit,) would have been too frivolous, to have been taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
               <p>One endeavor which I uſed for the ſpeaking ſomewhat of a <hi>Guide in Controverſie,</hi> was on the following occaſion. Dr. <hi>T.</hi> having called me to him, and deſiring (as he ſaid) that <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 21.</note> Mr. <hi>P. would ſtick to ſomething,</hi> took upon him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain a Text of Scripture, which had been long before Cited by Mr. <hi>P.</hi> for the Authority of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> That of St. <hi>Matthew, c.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>If he will not hear the Church let him be to thee as an Heathen and a Publican.</hi> The Doctor ſaid, that conſidering the Antecedent Verſes, this ought to be underſtood of ordinary Treſpaſſes, ſuch as <hi>the not paying of a juſt debt, &amp;c.</hi> And not of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, making uſe of a tedious Inſtance to that purpoſe, the ſumm whereof was <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>that in caſe a Man ſhould refuſe to pay his debts after one or two demands, he is put into the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Courts (ſuppoſing it proper for their cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance:)</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:41662:47"/>
                  <hi>And if he will not ſtand to their Sentence, then he is Excommunicated, and Treated as ſuch a One.</hi> Whereupon I told the Doctor, that for my own part, I underſtood that Text of Scripture quite otherwiſe than he did, being perſuaded that we were obliged by it to Hear the Church in all thoſe things, wherein the ſame Church doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that ſhe hath Power to Judge. And moſt eſpecially in matters of Faith: Which in their own Nature ſeem more proper for the <hi>Cogniſance of Eccleſiaſtical Courts</hi> than a Queſtion of Debt. That it was not unuſual for our Bleſſed Saviour on a particular occaſion to deliver a general Precept; as for inſtance, when the Jews ask'd him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no it were lawful to pay Tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. c. 22. v. 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> called for the <hi>Tribute-mony,</hi> and ask'd whoſe Image it bore; and being Anſwered that it was <hi>Caeſars;</hi> he gave this Rule, <hi>Render</hi> therefore <hi>unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things which are</hi> Caeſars. Which Rule, I ſuppoſe, is general, and hath regard not only to <hi>Tribute,</hi> but alſo to whatever elſe is due from Subjects to Sovereign Princes, as <hi>Reſpect, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and the like; tho' the occaſion on which the Rule was made, and that which immediately preceded it, ſeem to be Particular, and to look no farther than his Pecuniary Rights. That in like manner, tho' this Text, <hi>viz. If he will not hear the Church, &amp;c.</hi> might be ſpoken in a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occaſion, it could not be thence inferr'd, that it was not of a more large Extenſion, eſpecially if we ſhould compare it with other Texts, ſuch as are, <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. c. 20. v. 21.</note>

                  <hi>Obey thoſe that are ſet over you,—for they watch as being to render account for your Souls.</hi> All which places (at leaſt, according to my <hi>own</hi> Judgment) are clear for that Perpetuity, and that Authority of the Church, which are believed by Roman Catholics.</p>
               <p>But above all, this Truth ſeems to be moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to me, when I conſider what immediately follows in this place of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> When our Saviour had ſaid, <hi>If he will not hear the Church, let him be to thee as an Heathen, and a Publican,</hi> which is the ſubject of our preſent Controverſie, He adds in the very next Verſe [ſpeaking to his Church] <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> whatſoever <hi>you ſhall Bind on Earth, ſhall be Bound in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="*" place="margin">The Doctor ought to have conſidered what came after his Text, as well as what went before, the one having as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a regard to it as the other.</note> This Term WHATSOEVER, whether it regard the <hi>Perſons,</hi> or the <hi>Things</hi> which fall under the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure, or elſe <hi>Both,</hi> is of a moſt general Signification: So that it is evident, that the Power given in this place hath no other Reſtriction, or Limit, but the Will and Determination of thoſe to whom it is given, there being nothing more required for the <hi>Binding,</hi> or <hi>Looſing</hi> a Thing in Heaven, than that the Church ſhould determin to <hi>Bind,</hi> or <hi>Looſe</hi> it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41662:48"/>
on Earth. Which proves what I aſſerted above, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church hath Power to Judge in all thoſe things, wherein ſhe Declares Her ſelf to have it. [It is true however, that being always Guided by the ſame Holy Spirit, which inveſts her with this Authority, ſhe can never Declare Her ſelf to be our Judge, but where ſhe ought, and where it is highly for our Advantage, that ſhe ſhould be ſo.]</p>
               <p>My Diſcourſe on this occaſion was to this effect, but (as I have ſaid of thoſe on other ſubjects) much ſhorter, tho' this was the faireſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſpeaking that Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> allowed me, during the whole Conference. In Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I aſſured the Doctor, that I was wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the abovementioned Text (as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before) had quite another meaning, than what he gave of it. And therefore I ask'd him, whether, being ſo convinced as I was, I ought to follow his Interpretation or my own. He An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he would appeal to the Company, whether the Sence, which he gave of the place, were not <note n="*" place="margin">Had it been plain it would not have ſtood in need of his explanation.</note> plainly ſo. I told him that this would not ſerve my turn, for tho' that Company ſhould happen to be all of his Mind (as they were not, there being ſome amongſt them of my own Judgment) yet ſo long as my opinion continued as it was, I ſhould be ſtill at the ſame loſs, unleſs the Doctor could inform me, whoſe Judgment I was to truſt, my Own, or Theirs. The Doctor ſaid, that for the right Interpretation of Scripture, I ought to examin the Originals, conſult Learned Men <note n="*" place="margin">Why ſo much ado for what be ſaid was plain? Had the Company, he appealed to, done all this?</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas, ſaid he, <hi>this Boy did none of theſe things: he came not to Me, nor to his Maſter, &amp;c.</hi> and ſo
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41662:48"/>
ſtriking out of the Road, with a Cavil about the Boy, I could never get him into it again.</p>
               <p>Had I been able to have held him to the Point a little longer, he muſt have granted me according to his own principle of <hi>Every ones Power of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for himſelf,</hi> That ſeeing I Judged the Senſe of Holy Scripture to be Different from what he thought, I was as much bound to <hi>diſ-believe</hi> his Doctrin, as he was to <hi>believe</hi> it. Which would have been an excellent inſtance, how much Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi>'s <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith tended to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of it; And undoubtedly muſt have ſounded very ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Ears of his Pariſhioners, notwithſtanding their great eſteem and affection for him. Which I queſtion not, but the Doctor was well aware of, and therefore thought it more to his purpoſe, to chide the Boy for <hi>not having waſh'd his Face</hi> (as the Story goes of ſuch another <hi>Anſwerer)</hi> than to ſuffer the Diſputation to proceed. And yet this is the Doctor, who in this very place deſires, that his Adverſary would <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 21.</note>

               <p>I have already taken notice of a Sentence or two, which the Doctor ſets to my account, more than I can remember my ſelf to have been guilty of<hi>:</hi> There is another of them <hi>pa.</hi> 21. viz. <hi>Mr.</hi> M. <hi>asked Dr.</hi> T. <hi>if he could tell Chapter and Verſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Bible.</hi> And I think there are one or two more of the like nature: But they are of ſo little importance one way or other, that (tho' I believe they were never ſpoken by me, yet) they ſhall be <hi>ſaid,</hi> or <hi>not ſaid,</hi> as the Doctor pleaſes. But touching what he ſays, <hi>pa.</hi> 18. Of ſomething
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41662:49"/>
ſpoken to me about the Conference betwixt ſome Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> I remember nothing of it. Neither had I any concern in that Conference, or in any thing relating to it.</p>
               <p>In the Doctors <hi>22d.</hi> and <hi>23d.</hi> Pages, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will find the following Lines.<hi>—After this Dr.</hi> T. <hi>ſaid to Mr.</hi> P. <hi>there was one thing remaining and fit to be ſaid to him: He had in a Printed Paper promiſed not to tamper about Religion with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Boys who ſhould come to the Savoy-School; it had appeared, that he tampered with Boys out of his care, and would do ſo much more with thoſe under it: he ſaid it did not follow, becauſe of his word which he would not break, and that for this Boy he had done it in order to his everlaſting Salvation. Dr.</hi> T. <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that being your Principle, that all out of your Communion are Damned, you being a Jeſuit and a Papiſt, muſt break your word in that Paper for the neceſſary good (as you think) of the Souls of the Boys, eſpecially you having hope of turning Boys under your care. Mr.</hi> M. <hi>ſaid to Dr.</hi> T. <hi>This reflects upon the King. Another more loud, this reflects upon the King, and ſuggeſts, that he will break his word: And Mr.</hi> P. <hi>joyned in the Accuſation, but many of the Hearers cryed out againſt them, and ſaid it was a Knaviſh trick. Mr.</hi> M. <hi>was going away, Dr.</hi> T. <hi>called to him, and deſired him not to run away with a falſe Tale. Mr.</hi> M. <hi>denyed he ſaid ſuch words, Dr.</hi> T. <hi>told him he did, and that for his part he thought his Loyalty at this time to be more valuable than Mr.</hi> M's. <hi>Becauſe he as a Son of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>profeſſed he would not Rebell againſt the King, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:41662:49"/>
                  <hi>he might be of another Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Mr.</hi> M. <hi>being of the ſame Religion, could not ſo well ſeparate Loyalty from Intereſt. Dr.</hi> T. <hi>being concerned at this falſe and unworthy way of catching Men, did ſay, to Mr.</hi> M. <hi>at the Door of the firſt Room, that if he had perſiſted in this Trick, he could not have forborn to have given him the Name of Evidence</hi> Meredith.</p>
               <p>Here it is, that the Doctor Storms indeed! Here it is, that his Rage breaks forth<hi>!—Hunc tu, Romane, Caveto!</hi> Here it is, that he manifeſts the Truth of what he tells us in his Epiſtle to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners, and convinces us at length, <hi>that amidſt ſo many things there is</hi> ſomewhat <hi>ſincere!</hi> Here it is, that the loſs of his Fathers Benefice begins to work, and <hi>raiſes his Suſpicion and Indignation</hi> to ſo high a pitch, that, as he ſays, <hi>it is a difficulty to him to Temper himſelf!</hi>

               <p>What a deal of <hi>Billings-gate</hi> Rhetoric have we here, and all cramm'd into half a Page?

When we ſee <hi>Practices</hi> ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from <hi>Words,</hi> can we think, that his former Reprehenſion, was any other, than the doing that very thing which he ſeemed to Reprehend?</p>

is not hard to gueſs, how much Gall there is at the Fountain. Certainly had I been as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this Gentlemans Temper before our <hi>Conference,</hi> as I am by it, I ſhould have had one ſingle Exception againſt Dr. <hi>T.</hi> which would have put his <hi>three Exceptions againſt Mr.</hi> M. out of Countenance: I ſay, his <hi>Exceptions,</hi> not <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, foraſmuch as Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> ſeems to lay the blame of all his immoderate Heat on thoſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that were made on him during his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, I will not loſe ſo excellent an Opportunity (ſince I deſign rather to Benefit others, than Right my ſelf) of letting my Readers know the ſtrange Force of ſuch Impreſſions, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the great Care which the Education of their Children exacts from them. Which (I believe) I ſhall do, if I let them ſee, that Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> had not the leaſt Glympſe of Reaſon for all this Fury, but, that the whole (as far as we could perceive) was entirely owing to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Tincture which moſt unfortunately he had received, whileſt he was Young, and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, before he came to the Years of diſcretion. And I queſtion not, but the matter of fact rightly ſtated, and freed from the Doctors diſguiſes will effect This. And it is as follows,</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> ſpoke to this purpoſe, <hi>that whereas the Jeſuits had Publiſhed a Paper, in which they promiſe not to tamper about Religion with the Boys that come to their Schools, Mr.</hi> P. <hi>had meddled with one who was not his Scholar, and therefore it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, he would much more do ſo with ſuch as were.</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> replyed, <hi>It did not follow, he having given</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:41662:50"/>
                  <hi>his word for the one, but not for the other;</hi> adding, <hi>that he neither had, nor would</hi> break his word <hi>in that matter:</hi> Whereupon the Doctor ſaid the following words, <hi>If you are a Papiſt you muſt break your word.</hi> On theſe words, and ſpoken in theſe Circumſtances, I ſaid<hi>—This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects too far—Theſe things are not fit to be heard—</hi>And then retiring a ſtep or two, I came back to the Company again, and perceiving that no notice was taken by the Doctor of what I had ſaid on purpoſe that he might forbear ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes as, according to my judgment, might draw after them pernicious conſequences, that my Admonition might be yet plainer to him, I ſaid<hi>—This reflects upon the King—</hi>which was no more than what I meant by my former words, tho' then I forbore to name the King, as well out of a reſpect to His Majeſty, as becauſe I had no deſire, that the hint I then gave ſhould be taken notice of, any farther than by the Doctor himſelf; So far was I from any intention of <hi>catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> him, as he expreſſeth it; and even when I ſaw it neceſſary to ſpeak more plainly, that what I ſaid might have ſome effect, I did it in ſo low a voice, that I am confident the greateſt part of the Company did not hear me, at leaſt I deſired they ſhould not.</p>
               <p>I beg of my Readers to pauſe here a little while, and conſider, what it is, that is ſo heinous in all this proceeding: Let them diſcuſs every part and parcel of it as rigorouſly as they pleaſe, and then tell me, whether or no they can diſcover any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Motive,</hi> the Doctor had to his <hi>ſevere Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:41662:51"/>
on this occaſion, ſave only That, which (as he acquaints us in his forementioned Epiſtle) had lain by him for ſo many Years.</p>
               <p>Can any one affirm at this time of day, that ſuch Propoſitions, [viz. <hi>Papiſts are Breakers of their word,</hi> or <hi>If you are a Papiſt you muſt break your word]</hi> are fit to be vented, and Inſtilled into the Common People, and this too (that they may receive it with leſs heſitation) from the Mouths of thoſe, from whom they expect nothing but Goſpel? Was not the Jealouſie which the Author of the late <hi>Letter to a Diſſenter</hi> endeavored to raiſe, as if his Sacred Majeſty would be hindred by his Religion from complying with his <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. <hi>Of Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
                  </note> promiſe, the moſt Seditious part, of that moſt <hi>Seditious</hi> Piece, and (as I may ſay) the <hi>Venom</hi> of that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? And had not Dr. <hi>Teniſons</hi> Loyalty been more <hi>valuable</hi> by ſuch Expreſſions of his Abhorrence for that Pamplet, as the World hath received from the Tongues and Pens of many other Worthy Perſons, than it can appear by ſeeming, at leaſt, to joyn with the Author of it in that very Inſinuation, which (above all the reſt) renders him the moſt Deteſtable? And laſtly was it ſo weighty an Offence in me, to give the Doctor a Friendly hint of the inconvenience of ſuch Diſcourſes, that he is not contented with thoſe opprobrious Terms, he beſtow'd on me at the Conference, and wherewith he hath ſince aſperſed me in this Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, but ſtill (as I am told he does in a later Pamphlet) heaps Abuſe upon Abuſe, as if I had unpardonably Injured him by ſuffering the worſt of Injuries from him without Returning them,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41662:51"/>
or (hitherto) ſo much as Complaining of them? If this be the Doctors Loyalty, God grant his Majeſty better Subjects. If this be his Juſtice, God keep me from another Experiment of it. And laſtly, if this be his Morality: Will the Doctor take it ill, if we ſhould have ſo good an Opinion of thoſe Pariſhioners whom he ſo much extolls, as to hope that in his two large Pariſhes there are not Many but what are better Chriſtians than their Paſtor?</p>
               <p>It is true, that the Experience of many Years has rendred our Prince's Juſtice and Conſtancy ſo well known to all ſorts of People, that it muſt needs be hard for ſuch Inſinuations as theſe to find place amongſt them. However, when Men have been prevailed with to believe, that Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath not made good a Promiſe of his, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>being with his Church to the end of the World,</hi> ſhall we think it impoſſible, but that they may come to entertain as mean a thought as this of an Earthly Sovereign, how Great and Good ſoever he may be, eſpecially when theſe Talents which have ſucceeded ſo well in the greater undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are employed for the compaſſing of the leſs? The ſame vitious Inclination to Diſobedience and miſtaken Liberty, that rendred them plyable to the firſt Impoſture, is not leſſened but increaſed by their being deceived, and therefore of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence leaves them ſtill more diſpoſed for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. And certainly for theſe Reaſons, a moderate Caution, where any thing of this Danger appears, ought not to be look't on as either too Officious, or Superfluous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:41662:52"/>
Had this buſineſs been fairly Repreſented, Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> himſelf had been aſhamed of letting ſo much Choler break forth, where (even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Worldly Maxims) there was ſo little cauſe for it: And therefore if you take notice, you will find, that he has not permitted himſelf ſo far to be tranſported by his Paſſion, but that he <hi>hath taken Wit in his Anger,</hi> and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 83.</note> 
                  <hi>abhorrence of Shifting and Inſincerity</hi> hath (for reaſons eaſily diſcernible) related the matter of Fact quite otherwiſe than in truth it was. And therefore ſince this Gentleman in his <hi>46th.</hi> Page, promiſes <hi>a juſt Repreſentation of the whole,</hi> we muſt from henceforward conclude, that they are not Papiſts only, who are <hi>breakers of their Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> ſeems to affirm (as you will have ſeen) That it was on his ſaying to Mr. <hi>P.</hi> the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words [viz. <hi>That being your principle, that all out of your Communion are damned, you being a Ieſuit and a Papiſt, muſt break your word in the Paper for the neceſſary good (as you think) of the Souls of the Boys, eſpecially you having hope of turning Boys under your care]</hi> I ſay he ſeems to tell us, That on theſe words, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſaid to Dr. <hi>T. This reflects upon the King.</hi> Now for my own part I deſire, that my Portion in Gods favor may be no farther ſure, than this is Falſe: Which, were I not very certain of what I here relate, I would not ſay for ten thouſand Worlds.

were thoſe which I noted above, viz. <hi>If you are a Papiſt, you muſt break your word.</hi> For had the Doctor ſpoken of this matter in the words of his preſent Narrative, I am well aſſured, that I ſhould not have made that Reflection on it: For altho' the ſpeech, even as himſelf puts it, cannot be look'd on as very ſeaſonable in this juncture of Affairs, yet that Reſtriction of<hi>—you being a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit,</hi> (however <hi>forced</hi> and <hi>improper</hi> as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by what <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>The Sentence which I reflected on was ſo plainly lyable to ſuch a Remark, that (as Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> confeſſes) two or three immediately joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me in it.

However, the Doctor ought not to appear Vertuous at his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors coſt, he ought not ſo far to conſult his own <hi>Good Name,</hi> as not to care what becomes of mine. Eſpecially, when the value of Reputation is ſo well known to him, that he thinks it worth his while (as may be perceived by his above-cited Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Epiſtle) to raiſe the whole <hi>poſſe</hi> of two large Pariſhes to <note n="*" place="margin">But twice as much would be little enough to preſerve it, ſhould it pleaſe God, that the Truth of this very paſſage alone, were fully known.</note> preſerve it.</p>

was under no preciſe neceſſity of taking ſuch a courſe as this, for the clearing of himſelf. He might have declared, that this Sentence dropt from him in the eagerneſs of Diſcourſe and at unawares. We ſhould not have been ſo ſevere to his lapſes, as he is to <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpellings, and the like.</hi>
                  </note> ours. We do not think, that our Cauſe is ſo near <hi>Sinking,</hi> that we ſhould catch at ſuch Twigs to keep it above Water. He might have ſaid, that tho' his Expreſſion reach'd to all Roman Catholics, he had no intention of including more than the Jeſuits. This (in ſome meaſure at leaſt) would have ſav'd both his Credit, and mine. Nay, if he had ſo pleaſed, he might have blamed the Inference which I had drawn from his Diſcourſe, ſince I had much rather, that his Cenſure ſhould have fallen on my Judgment than on my Integrity. For I can aſſure him, that I eſteem it (whatever he may do) a leſs Inconvenience to be thought Weak in the former than Defective in the latter. Wherefore to conclude, there having been other ways of complying with that ſtrong innate principle of ſelf-preſervation, it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the more afflicting to me, that he ſhould pitch on no other means of wiping off his own Spots, but by Aſperſing me.</p>
               <p>Methinks, this haſty and inconſiderate Speech (if it were ſuch) might have ſeem'd to him as fair an opportunity of asking pardon, as ſome other of his ſayings have done, ſuch as were, <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 13. and 17.</note>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41662:55"/>
does it not look ſomewhat like <hi>Straining at a Guat and Swallowing a Camel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that immediately after the Doctor had ended his wrangling about this matter with Mr. <hi>P.</hi> he called after me, and (as I think) <hi>deſired me not to run away with a falſe Tale,</hi> telling me, that his words were<hi>—You being a Ieſuit and a Papiſt, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>that (he hoped) the King was not a Ieſuit, and therefore that his ſpeech could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him.</hi> I replyed, in theſe expreſs Terms. <hi>Your words [viz.</hi> Thoſe which I had taken notice of] <hi>were not You being a Ieſuit and a Papiſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but If you are a Papiſt, you muſt break your word.</hi> I ſaid moreover, <hi>that I had no deſign to Inform againſt him,</hi> as ſome in the Crowd had mutter'd, and <hi>that my Intention in taking notice of his words was no other, than</hi> (what I have had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to intimate before) <hi>that he might learn to be ſomewhat more Cautions and Deliberate in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes for the future.</hi> Now, how comes the Doctors <hi>True Account</hi> to be wholly ſilent in ſo material a paſſage? But the Cauſes of Complaint come ſo thick, that I muſt beg leave to forbear the making it now and then: It being hard for me to vary my phraſe as often as a new Injury ſeems to require it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>M.</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>denied he ſaid ſuch words, viz.</hi> That the Doctors Propoſition had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the King.</p>
               <p>The confuſion was ſo great at this time (there being then three or four bawling about my Ears at once) that I cannot well call to mind what I ſaid;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41662:55"/>
only thus much I diſtinctly remember, <hi>viz.</hi> That one of the Doctors Friends affirmed again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>that I had not ſpoken thoſe words,</hi> whom I did not contradict, partly becauſe I was not well aſſur'd whether or no I had ſaid, what was then particularly mentioned, in ſuch manner as to be heard by any of the Company, having (as I ſaid before) ſpoken very low; and partly becauſe I deſir'd that the Doctor might receive as little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction, as it was poſſible, and therefore ſince I underſtood, he knew already what fault had been found with his Propoſition (which was all I aimed at) I was loath to diſquiet him farther by repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing That, which, tho' reaſonably enough urged, had yet been ungrateful to him. But if any word dropt from me through ſuddenneſs of Speech, that implyed ſuch a Denyal as the Doctor mentions, it was more than I intended, and muſt be attributed to that diſtraction of mind which is hardly avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able amidſt ſuch Peals of various Diſcourſes, where the Attention being called upon by many Different matters at once, is ſufficiently applyed to none. For as ſoon as the Doctor (who ſeemed to ſuſpect, that I meditated on ſome Information againſt him, and therefore, not to be contented with my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence) urged me by the continuance of his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations to declare my ſelf in more expreſs Terms, I was far from Diſowning that I had Reflected on his forementioned Propoſition, as the Reader will have perceived by what he met with in my laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, where I repeat ſome part of our Diſcourſe on this occaſion, in which I acknowledged that I had Reflected on the Doctors Words, but denyed that it was with any other Deſign, ſave only, that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41662:56"/>
he himſelf might <hi>Reflect</hi> a little more on ſuch as he ſhould purpoſe to ſpeak for the future: A Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which (God knows) the beſt of us ſtand in need of.</p>
               <p>But whereas ſome perſons of that Company ſpoke as if I had declared, <hi>that the Doctor had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the King,</hi> and that on ſuch a ſuppoſition I had an Intention of Informing againſt him, it is not improbable, but that this (or any thing elſe which I ſhould have taken to have had this mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) might have been flatly denyed by me. For I look'd on it as one thing, <hi>For the Doctor to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the King,</hi> and another <hi>for his Propoſition to have done ſo;</hi> ſince for the Truth of the former, it ſeem'd neceſſary to me, that the Doctor ſhould have actually thought on the King (and Reflected on him in his mind) when he ſpoke thoſe Words; which poſſibly he might not do. [Nay, I cannot do him ſo much Injury as to imagin, that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood (I do not ſay, the whole extent, but even) the obvious Conſequences of many of his Speeches at this Conference; ſince, if he had done ſo, I queſtion not, but he would have omitted them.] But on the other hand, that a Propoſition may be truly ſaid <hi>to Reflect on the King,</hi> nothing elſe is required, than by a Natural and Eaſie Inference, It ſhould appear to include him within its Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. As for Example, when <hi>all</hi> Papiſts are ſaid to be Breakers of their Word (ſince we cannot have a better inſtance than we have in the preſent Caſe) the King is manifeſtly included: Tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Speaker may not reflect that he is ſo. Wherefore I ſay, I might deny, that I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the Doctor <hi>of Reflecting on the King,</hi> and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41662:56"/>
yet at the ſame time affirm, that his Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did.</p>
               <p>This conſideration leads me to another Remark, <hi>which is,</hi> that tho' every tittle of what the Doctor here relates ſhould be true (as it is not) and tho' I ſhould have had a purpoſe of Informing (as was likewiſe falſely imagined) yet the Doctor was too haſty in charging me with <hi>running away with a falſe Tale.</hi> For what Tale had the Doctor heard from me, that was Falſe? The Doctor had ſpoken cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain words: And I affirmed that ſuch <hi>words</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the King. Where is the Falſeneſs of this Story? Or rather, what <hi>Story</hi> is there in This? I ſaid not (as I told you juſt now) that the Doctor Reflected on the King, but that his <hi>Words</hi> Reflected on him; which tho' it had been falſe (unleſs I had ſpoken contrary to my own mind) had been the Error of Judgment, or a fault in my <hi>Inferring Faculty,</hi> and not a Lie, as the Doctor would have it. I preſume, that thoſe who hold <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and <hi>Purgatory</hi> will not paſs for Lyars with the Doctor, according to the propriety of our Common Speech, tho' at the ſame time he may take ſuch Tenets to be Erroneous, and the Arguments that are brought to prove them, Sophiſms. Wherefore in this Particular Caſe, altho' my Inference had been Bad, my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience might have been Good, ſince it muſt needs go very hard with the World if every Man were to be as ill a Chriſtian, as he is a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician.</p>
               <p>All the Information (had I intended any ſuch thing) which I could, or ſhould have given in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41662:57"/>
this matter, was, <hi>that</hi> Dr. <hi>Teniſon, had ſpoken ſuch Words as I had heard from him, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Judgment thoſe</hi> Words <hi>Reflected on the King.</hi> But whether they did ſo, or not, or how far the Doctor was culpable or innocent, muſt have been left to others to determine. And after this if the Doctor, and his <hi>Words</hi> both, ſhould have been Acquitted; it might perhaps have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him how greatly it was for his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that his <hi>Words</hi> were not left to a Private Interpretation (as he leaves God Almighties) but that proper Judges had been choſen out and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized for that purpoſe. This Reflection, I ſay, might Naturally enough have come into the Doctors mind. But I cannot think, that it would have appeared to thoſe Judges (whoſoever they ſhould be) or to any other ſober perſon, that I had been guilty of any Perjurious Teſtimony in this Proceeding, as the Doctors <hi>Knaviſh Trick, Falſe Tale,</hi> and the reſt of his Civil Language would imply. And this is another Reaſon why the Doctors <hi>Civilities</hi> ought not to have gone from before his own Door.</p>
               <p>The bare <hi>matter of Fact</hi> in the forementioned buſineſs ſingly related (as I ſaid at firſt) would have been ſufficient, to have ſhewn the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of Dr. <hi>Teniſons</hi> Paſſion; however I have added theſe few Remarks, that it might the more fully appear, how laſting and forcible an Influence theſe <hi>Early</hi>

                        <hi>One good end for which I ſaid theſe places might be viſited, was to take ſuch Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as ſhould happen for the</hi> diverting Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from what was Seditious, Idle, or Profane, to that which was Serious and Uſeful, either for This Life, or the Next, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This, <hi>I ſaid,</hi> was a Miſſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>y Zeal, and therefore what the Children of the Reformation were little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. <hi>The Doctor anſwers,</hi> That tho' he be no Friend to Seditious, Idle, or Profane Diſcourſes, yet it looks oddly to turn Places of Diverſion into Schools of Diſputing. <hi>He ſtill puts things upon the</hi> ſtretch, <hi>as if there were no other way of diverting thoſe Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but by Scholaſtic Diſputations, which were not mentioned by me. However, the Doctor muſt be too great a</hi> Friend <hi>to Seditious Diſcourſes, not to think even ſuch Diſputations much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and therefore, at leaſt when there is no other way of putting an end to the</hi> former, <hi>it cannot be ill done to introduce the</hi> latter. <hi>But the Doctor likes not this</hi> Miſſionary <hi>Zeal: as if, forſooth, it were the worſe becauſe it want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Approbation. I queſtion not but he likes the Reformation as well for not ſending Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into</hi> China, <hi>as for not endeavouring to</hi> do good <hi>in Coffee-houſes. The Doctor may call to mind what Inſtructions were given by St.</hi> Paul <hi>to</hi> Timothy, viz. <hi>That he ſhould be zealous in his Exhortations, even to importunity, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well</hi> out of ſeaſon, <hi>as in it; and then perhaps he will not think it ſuch a mortal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to endeavour the reclaiming of a Soul from Error or Vice, whereſoever a probability of doing it, or even a poſſibility, ſhall appear, eſpecially when he conſiders that ſome men are ſuch ſtudious ſhunners of Pious Inſtructions, that unleſs they meet with them amidſt their Paſtimes, and when they leaſt think of them, they will always want them.

                        <hi>But the Keepers of theſe Houſes will be Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers by ſuch Diſputes,</hi> for men do not love to lace their Coffee with Controverſies. <hi>Dr.</hi> St. <hi>knows how great an Argument Gain is with moſt men. The Author of</hi> a Seaſonable Diſcourſe againſt Popery <hi>did it before him, when he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed two of his main</hi> Diſſuaſives <hi>to the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers and the Lawyers, putting them in mind that if Catholic Religion ſhould be reſtored in</hi> England, <hi>the one would be impoveriſh'd by</hi> Faſting-days, <hi>and the other by</hi> Appeals to Rome, <hi>and ſo engaging that Paſſion</hi> [viz. <hi>the love of Money] to be of his ſide, which as a Divine he ought to have preached againſt.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41662:59"/>
to make out; for as my ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſome Lyes were told in Coffee-houſes, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on all thoſe who frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, (nay, I was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually endeavouring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the <hi>frequenting them)</hi> ſo neither could my intimating that the Pulpits had been lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſome part of that Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, concern all thoſe who Preached in them. Indeed my Complement (as the Doctor calls it) was ſo far from being deſign'd by me to all the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don-Clergy,</hi> that I directed it not to Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himſelf, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his own Conſcience ſhould look on it as belonging to him. However, had he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it to himſelf, I ſhould not have contended ſo much to have reſcu'd it out of his hands.

Countreys and Ages, and even his own Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign?</p>
               <p>Theſe are two Inſtances what Uſe theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can make of their <hi>Inferring Faculties,</hi> when they ſee it for their purpoſe. Is there any thing here half ſo plain, or ſo naturally deduced, as that which I drew from Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi>'s Propoſition? Nay rather, are not the Inferences of theſe two Doctors evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forced, whereas mine is genuine, and obvious even to the meaneſt Underſtanding? And yet <hi>baſe and unworthy ways of catching men,</hi> are laid to my charge, and theſe Gentlemen paſs for Plain-dealers. But this will not always be ſo. There is a time to come, in which <hi>there will be nothing of what is now hidden, but what ſhall be revealed.</hi> And then it will appear how ill a choice thoſe have made, who have preferred Fame before Truth, and the ſaving of their Credit before the ſaving of their Souls.</p>
               <p>The Doctor ſays farther, <hi>That for his part he thought his Loyalty at this time to be more</hi> valuable <hi>than Mr.</hi> M.<hi>'s, becauſe he, as a Son of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>profeſſed he would not</hi> Rebel <hi>againſt the King, notwithſtanding he might be of another Religion: whereas Mr.</hi> M. <hi>being of the ſame Religion, could not ſo well ſeparate Loyalty from Intereſt.</hi>

               <p>Now, <hi>for my part,</hi> tho' I hold <hi>Works of Superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> yet I am far from thinking Loyalty (at leaſt, as it is here <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. <hi>A not</hi> Rebelling <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King.</hi>
                  </note> deſcrib'd) to be one of thoſe: And therefore it is my opinion, that we ought as little to <hi>value</hi> our ſelves on our not being Rebels, as we would do on our not being Thieves or Murderers; nay, rather leſs, foraſmuch as Theft and Murther are certainly leſs Criminal than Rebellion. And
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41662:60"/>
therefore a Loyalty to be boaſted of (if there be any ſuch) muſt be ſomewhat more than an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Obedience. However, if the Doctor think his Loyalty at this time more <hi>valuable</hi> than mine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he demeans himſelf peaceably under a Prince of a different Religion, he ought to remember, that for <hi>three years</hi> which he hath lived ſo, it has fallen to my ſhare to paſs over <hi>twelve</hi> in the ſame manner, only with this difference, that <hi>He</hi> enjoys entire Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of a Free-born Subject, (ſitting under a <hi>large</hi> Fig-tree, and gathering the Fruit of a <hi>well-ſpread</hi> Vine) and is promis'd the continuance of them; having no other <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> cauſe of diſquiet, ſave only (what ought to prompt him to nothing but Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) the bare Contemplation, that were it not for the Goodneſs of his Sovereign, it might have been otherwiſe. Theſe, I ſay, are his Enjoyments during this great trial of his Fidelity: whereas I, on the other ſide, during my Probation, was not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd of thoſe Advantages which my Education might have pretended to, but for ſome time even of the Open Air; and even this kind of Life was ſo precariouſly enjoy'd by us, and we were ſo far from being <hi>aſſured</hi> of any Continuance of it, that were it not for our Confidence in God's Mercy, we could have expected nothing elſe but immediate Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Now, when theſe two things are put into the Ballance; I mean the two different Trials of Dr. <hi>Teni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Loyalty and <hi>Mine;</hi> I cannot but think that the Advantage will be on my ſide: and this even tho' the Doctor himſelf (which perhaps is a bold word) ſhould hold the Scales. Wherefore, if any <hi>value</hi> accrue to Loyalty from ſuch kind of Trials, <hi>That</hi> certainly which has undergon the longeſt and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41662:60"/>
ought to be the moſt prized. Neither is there any reaſon why my Loyaly ſhould loſe that <hi>value</hi> in the Calm, which (according to this Rule) it muſt have acquir'd in the Storm. On the contrary, it is then chiefly that the Labours of a Souldier are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, when the War is at an end; and even by Rewards his Merit is not leſſen'd (tho' his Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be) but declared.</p>

               <p>Beſides, had the Doctor been that <hi>Loyal Man</hi> he pretended, tho' he had thought me a little too <hi>haſty</hi> in this occaſion; ought he to have ſnapt me up ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteouſly, and with ſo much bitterneſs of Spirit, for an expreſſion, which, tho' taken by him for ill-grounded, could not but be look'd on as Loyal? Methinks (I ſay) the Loyalty of my Admonition might have made ſome Attonement for the <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> Error of it; and the Doctor, who is ſo good at gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Grains of Allowance,</hi> might (one would think) <note place="margin">Page 7.</note> have extended his Charity to Me alſo; eſpecially when the Zeal for Loyalty needed not to have been extraordinary in him, for the overlooking of ſo ſmall a Fault.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Similis ſimili gaudet:</hi> Had the Doctor been as much a Loyaliſt in his Heart, as (ſeemingly at leaſt) he was the contrary in his words, he would have cheriſhed Loyalty, where-ever he had found it, even
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41662:61"/>
even tho' mingled with ſome Indiſcretion. He may remember how cordially the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>Loyal</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>England-men</hi> and the <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> lov'd one another during the Civil Wars; when the difference of Perſuaſion was not more powerful to divide their Underſtandings, than a conſtant Fidelity to their Prince to unite their Affections.

               <p>But after all, I will not much contend with Dr. <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon</hi> in the forementioned Point.

And had the Doctor's eſteem for Loyalty been ſo extraordinary before our Acquaintance, his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe had not drawn ſuch a fruitleſs Admonition from me, nor my Admonition ſo much unjuſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from him.</p>

                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:41662:61"/>
There are ſeveral other Remarks which would offer themſelves to me on this Subject<hi>:</hi> But the Filth which is ſo copiouſly rak'd together in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, is no ſuch inviting ſight, as that I ſhould continue to pore on it. However, there is one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation which prevails with me for a little long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtay. I cannot but call to mind what Sacred things the <hi>King's Witneſſes</hi> were, during the late pretended Popiſh-Plot, notwithſtanding that thoſe who preſented themſelves for that Employment were known to be the moſt profligate Wretches alive: whereas as ſoon as that Phantôm vaniſhed, and a <hi>true Plot</hi> (bred under the Shadow of this <hi>falſe One)</hi> was happily detected, then nothing was ſo ſcandalous with ſome Men as one of theſe <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;</hi> ſuch, I mean, as were then for the King: Such a ſtrange Perverſeneſs is there in ſome Natures, that what is for their turn, tho' ever ſo Diabolical, ſhall be Saintly with them; but what is otherwiſe, tho' Truth, Juſtice, or Piety, ſhall be look'd on as the moſt deteſtable thing in the World. Whil'ſt the Witneſſes were Falſe, it was a ſin to aſperſe them; but as ſoon as they came to be True, their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treaſons were held leſs Crimes, than their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſcovery of them. And it was about this time, <hi>viz.</hi> whil'ſt the Real Plot was under Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, that the Doctor's Nick name of <hi>Evidence</hi> began to come in uſe. Indeed the former Witneſſes were every way ſo abominable, that the very name of a Witneſs ſeem'd Ignominious; and therefore it was the eaſier for the Enemies of the Crown to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent that as <hi>Odious</hi> in it ſelf, which was only <hi>ſo</hi> when accompanied with Falſhood. And hence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41662:62"/>
of vilifying Perjur'd Witneſſes in particular, they ſlily brought a diſcredit on all Witneſſes in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, at leaſt on Thoſe who (as I have ſaid) were for the King, and ſo falſly pretending to remedy one Evil, they endeavoured to introduce a Greater; it being certainly a leſs Miſchief to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that ſome <hi>Falſe</hi> Witneſſes ſhould be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, than that None ſhould be look'd on as <hi>True.</hi> Wherefore I hope the Doctor means ſomewhat worſe by the Nick-name he beſtows on me, than barely the <hi>being a Witneſs for the King,</hi> ſince (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God) I am not yet ſo unmortified, but that I had rather be reputed a Falſe Evidence, tho' the worſt of Diſgraces, than that the being a <hi>True Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the King's behalf</hi> ſhould be eſteemed a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: It being better that His Majeſty ſhould want the Teſtimony of one ſingle Perſon, tho' ever ſo unjuſtly, than that he ſhould be depriv'd of That of all his Subjects.</p>
               <p>This Pamphlet grows more bulky than I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore, having ſaid as much as I thought fit on the things contain'd in Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi>'s Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, I purpoſe to be much ſhorter concerning that which remains.</p>
               <p>The Doctor in his 57th Page quotes a <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. <hi>His Diff. betwixt Prot. and Socin. Meth.</hi> p. 26.</note> Work of his own in theſe Words; <hi>Though he [the</hi> Right So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian] <hi>thinks a Doctrin is plain in Scripture, yet if he believes it to be againſt</hi> HIS REASON, <hi>he aſſents not to it.</hi> And p. 27. <hi>A Man of this Church [of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land] <hi>ſuſpects not</hi> Reaſon it ſelf, <hi>but his own</hi> preſent Art of Reaſoning, <hi>whenſoever it concludes againſt that which he reads, and reads without doubting of the</hi>

                  <hi>Senſe of the Words.</hi> This he lays down for the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto I have taken the Socinians <hi>at leaſt</hi> for a witty Generation<hi>:</hi> But henceforward, if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Character of them be true, I muſt hold them all for Blockheads, on pain of being held for one my ſelf. For what is it <hi>to think a Doctrin plain in</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Suppoſing Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be the Word of God.</note> 
                  <hi>Scripture,</hi> but <hi>to think it to be revealed by God?</hi> And conſequently, what is it <hi>not to believe a Doctrin which is thought to be plain in Scripture,</hi> but <hi>not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what is thought to be revealed by God?</hi> And is not this in other terms to ſuppoſe <hi>that it is poſſible for God to reveal a Falſhood?</hi> Wherefore if this be the ſign of a <hi>Right Socinian,</hi> as the Doctor would have it, a <hi>Bedlam</hi> is fitter for him than an <hi>Inquiſition.</hi> But the truth is, the Socinians are not ſuch Fools as this Gentleman would make them; They do not think the Doctrin they reject to be plain in Scripture: Nay, before they reject it, they conclude it not to be <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> Arians <hi>and</hi> Socinians <hi>are ſo far from thinking the Catholic Doctrin touching the Divinity of our Savior to be</hi> plain <hi>in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that they think the contrary to be</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>there; bringing for in many Texts; as,</hi> My Father is greater than I, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 28. <hi>and the like; which the Doctor knows well enough.</hi>
                  </note> plain. Wherefore in thoſe points wherein they differ from the Catholics, what the One un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands Literally in the Word of God, the Other interprets Myſtically or Figuratively. And in reference to theſe Texts they behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no otherwiſe than the Proteſtants do to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe Words of our Savior in the Inſtitution of the Bleſſed Sacrament, <hi>viz. This is my Body;</hi> which they will not underſtand in a Literal Senſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:41662:63"/>
Again, the Doctor ſays, That a Church-of-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-man <hi>ſuſpects not Reaſon it ſelf, but his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Art of Reaſoning.</hi> I have not time to ſpeculate on the nicety of this Diſtinction, and ſo I let it paſs; altho' I believe that a Socinian would be extreme glad to know how he might come to be guided by <hi>Reaſon it ſelf,</hi> when he <hi>ſuſpects his preſent Art of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">What cauſeth a Church-of-England-man to ſuſpect his preſent Art of Reaſoning? Is it not his preſent Art of Reaſoning? Can Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon guide him without any Reaſoning? The Doctor ſeems to be very ſubtil here.</note>. Is not the Faculty to be ſuſpected, when its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is faulty? Can the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be Perfect, and yet the Reaſoning which flows from it Defective? But whereas the Doctor's Church-of-England-man <hi>ſuſpects his own preſent Art of Reaſoning, whenſoever it concludes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which he reads, and reads without doubting of the Senſe of the Words:</hi> I dare likewiſe engage, that whatſoever the <hi>Right</hi> Socinian reads in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture without <hi>doubting</hi> of the Senſe of the Words, he ſhall believe as firmly as any Church-of-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-man in the World. This is proved already; and if the Doctor think otherwiſe, I ſhall have cauſe to ſuſpect (if not his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> yet at leaſt) his <hi>preſent Art of Reaſoning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon why I have examined this Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, becauſe it is taken out of a Book, which I am recommended to by the Doctor for an Anſwer to thoſe Queſtions I would have propos'd to him at the Conference.

Party, and, <hi>at leaſt,</hi> to make Work for his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
               <p>And now I would not have the Senſe of what I have ſaid here, or elſewhere, on this Subject, ſo far miſtaken, as that I ſhould be thought to look on ſuch <hi>Perſonal</hi> and <hi>Written</hi> Conferences as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means of deciding Controverſies; whereas I only prefer this way of proceeding in them before that of writing Books. I know there is nothing of this Nature, which ſome time or other is not liable to the underminings of Craft; and therefore (as far as I have been able to obſerve) when ſuch kind of Conferences are obtained, (which is only where they cannot be kept off with any credit) the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants either refuſe to diſpute of the Main Points, ſuch as the Rule of Faith, the Proof of Scripture, or the like, and fall on ſome other Branch, where (as I have ſaid before) there is more room for diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, unleſs the matter be ſoon brought to the Rule of Faith, as it may, and indeed ought to be: Or elſe, if they admit of any ſuch Point, they endeavor to ſpend the time in Preliminaries, ſo that they may be forced to break off before any Argument comes to bear. All the Written Conferences that I have heard of (which have not been above two or three) have been of this ſort. However the Truth of what paſſes at a Conference is better known by this means, and the ſhuffling (on which ſide ſoever it ſhall happen to be) more diſcernible. Beſides, I never knew that any of theſe Conferences were followed by Noiſe, tho' the Copies of them have been diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted through many hands. All things have been huſh'd, and no contradictory Narratives have come
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41662:64"/>
abroad to the <hi>dividing,</hi> rather than <hi>ſatisfying</hi> the World: Excepting only Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s Conference with Mr. <hi>G.</hi> where Mr. <hi>G.</hi>'s Amanuenſis happening to take away his Copy without comparing it with Dr. <hi>St.</hi>'s, there chanced to be a ſmall difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe Copies which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> diſperſed, and that which the Doctor retained; and from this trivial Over-ſight (to ſay the utmoſt of it) Dr. <hi>St.</hi> took a pretence to accuſe Mr. <hi>G.</hi> of Inſincerity, and to refuſe the meeting with him any more. But this (as is evident) may eaſily be prevented, and Mr. <hi>G.</hi> himſelf did it afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> by truſting the Proteſtants themſelves to write both his part and their own, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And certainly, if there were no other convenience in Writing, This alone were enough to render it deſirable. And as for the Conferences themſelves, tho' (as I have ſaid) there is care taken to ſpend the time (which the Writing alſo helps to do) in uſeleſs Diſcourſes, yet after the firſt or ſecond Meeting, when all the looſe Earth ſhall be digg'd away in order to a Foundation, it is probable that ſomewhat may be built.—But the worſt of the matter is, that for the moſt part we are careful to take ſuch Exceptions at the Firſt Meeting, as may juſtifie our refuſal of a Second.</p>

was not till after I had retir'd from Dr. <hi>T.</hi> and Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and came back again to them, according to what I have related above. And this may be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proved from what the Schoolmaſter ſays in his 9th page, viz. <hi>When the Queſtion of [How the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants could tell that the Bible they uſed was really what they (the Proteſtants) thought it to be, the Word of God?] had been canvaſs'd ſome while, Mr.</hi> M. <hi>ariſing, went to the other end of the Room,</hi> &amp;c.

                     </gap> to ſay to Mr.</hi> M. <hi>He choſe to diſpute rather with Ladies than Doctors.</hi> I acquainted my Readers in my 5th page, That not long after the beginning of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, a Catholic Gentlewoman advis'd me to withdraw from it. But really whether ſhe had a Maſque in her hand, or not, I cannot tell; and therefore herein I muſt yield to the Doctor, and confeſs that He is the more curious <hi>Obſerver of Ladies</hi> of the two. Neither did ſhe come then into the Conference, as the Doctor ſeems to expreſs it, but had been there for ſome time; for ſhe had obſerved that Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> took the advantage of my being near him, to turn frequently from Mr. <hi>P.</hi> to me, and <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Above</hi> pa. 5.</note> ſo <hi>vice versâ</hi> from Me to Him, by which means the Proſecution of the Arguments was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. And it was for this reaſon (as ſhe told me) and alſo that the Doctor might not have a falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his <hi>contending with two at once,</hi> that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41662:65"/>
me to retire, according to the account I have given of this matter in the afore-cited place. It was not therefore <hi>to avoid diſputing with Dr.</hi> Teniſon, as the Doctor's Lady ſurmized (for it ſeems there were <hi>Ladies</hi> on both ſides) that I withdrew, but it was <hi>that the Doctor might not avoid diſputing with Mr.</hi> P. And if I am not miſtaken, I was then talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Schoolmaſter, when this Witticiſm [recorded by the Doctor] was ſpoken. There was a ſecond Gentlewoman who joyn'd with <hi>this</hi> in the ſame Advice; but neither of them ſpoke before Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had deſir'd me of his own accord to leave the Diſputation, tho' the Doctor ſeems here to ſuppoſe the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Doctor takes occaſion in ſeveral places of his Book to give us to underſtand that the foremention'd Apprentice was much chang'd in Humor and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance after his Converſion, and particularly <hi>that he ſeem'd often as if he were</hi>

                  <hi>mop'd.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Hornec</hi> ſeems to concur with him in this account. We know what kind of Spectacles Love and Hatred are to look through, and how much for the moſt part they impoſe upon our Fancies. Certainly the Boy's * <hi>ſmiling</hi> at Dr. <hi>H.</hi>'s <hi>pretending to Succeſſion</hi> was no ſign of Stupidity; the wiſeſt man in the World <note place="margin">Pag. 79. <hi>in Dr.</hi> H.<hi>'s Letter.</hi>
                  </note> might have been guilty of ſome <hi>Laughter</hi> on that occaſion. But for my own part, that which I think moſt worth the <hi>ſmiling</hi> at in this paſſage, is that Dr. <hi>H.</hi> makes <hi>no bones</hi> of proving this Succeſſion; whereas Dr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaid at the Conference, that it could not be done under Ten Thouſand Pounds worth of Books. <hi>Something</hi> (ſays Dr. <hi>H.)

               <p>There is but one way (that I know) of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling theſe two Doctors, and that is by laying it down as a Principle, <hi>That there are</hi> Two <hi>ways of Manifeſting a Proteſtant Succeſſion.</hi> One is, <hi>by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Societies or Perſons in all Ages, who have openly profeſſed the Doctrin of the Church of England.</hi> And this, I preſume, cannot be perform'd under Ten or Twenty Thouſand Pounds worth of Books.

                  <hi>that the Church of</hi> England <hi>before the Reformation was in the Church of</hi> Rome; and then the <hi>Proof</hi> of this <hi>Succeſſion</hi> will come very cheap, and if you give <hi>Six-pence</hi> for it, it will be more than it is worth.

               <p>VVHil'ſt theſe latter Sheets were in the Preſs, Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi>'s new Book [entituled, <hi>Mr.</hi> Pulton <hi>Conſidered]</hi> came forth. I caſt my Eye on it; but having read the Preface, I found ſo many things which requir'd the Black Note, that I was afraid to enter farther into the Book, leſt I ſhould be overwhelm'd with matter, and ſo either tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to lengthen my own Pamphlet, (which I would not willingly do) or elſe remain under a kind of vexation by ſeeing many Fallacies without expoſing them when they ſhould ſeem to lie in my way. Wherefore, to avoid both theſe Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I deſir'd a Friend who had read the Book to inform me what there was in it that had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to my ſelf, that ſo I might either note, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it, as I ſhould ſee cauſe. And as for the reſt of this <hi>Worthy Piece</hi> (wherein the Doctor, as far as I obſerved him, hath outdone himſelf in many of thoſe laudable Qualities I have ſpoken of above) I knew that ſo far as it ſhould be thought neceſſary,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41662:67"/>
it would be under the Examination of a better Artiſt.</p>
               <p>The Doctor ſays in his forementioned Preface, That he went to this Conference <hi>in the ſimplicity of a Chriſtian, as to a private Diſcourſe; which</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Arts of others have improv'd into a public Brawl.</hi> Whom the Doctor means by <hi>others</hi> in this place, I cannot well tell: But I am apt to imagin, that They who were conſcious either of the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Cauſe before the Conference, or of their ill Succeſs in it, would not be over-fond of making the thing public. For my part, I am ſo charitable as to think there were no <hi>Arts</hi> uſed by either Side for this purpoſe; the buſineſs was ſo carried, that it could not well be otherwiſe: Nay, there were ſo many Hearers of both Sexes, (and <hi>Five</hi> of the Doctor's Party for <hi>One</hi> of ours) at this Conference, that it had been the greateſt Art in the World to have kept it ſecret: But for the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of theſe People, if there were any fault in it, I know not whom to blame, unleſs it be the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Houſe, who doubtleſly might have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed entrance to as many as he pleaſed. But perhaps the Good Man reckon'd upon nothing leſs than a complete Victory, and (in conſequence of that) the Recovery of his <hi>loſt Sheep,</hi> and therefore (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a <hi>Goſpel-Example,</hi> tho' ſomewhat too ſoon) invited his Neighbors and Acquaintance to rejoyce with him. And if this proved inconvenient to the Doctor, he may learn by it, that it is not always for his advantage that his Pariſhioners ſhould have too great an Opinion of him; but in the mean time there is no manner of reaſon why he ſhould be angry at Us, becauſe his own Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41662:67"/>
were miſtaken; unleſs it be <hi>ſuch</hi> as men that ſtumble have of quarrelling with thoſe who ſhall happen to be near them, tho' they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed nothing to their Miſchance.</p>
               <p>He goes on to amuſe his Pariſhioners, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them of high Accuſations lay'd by Catholic Writers on ſeveral of his Brethren, of <hi>Inſincerity, Diſingenuity, Want of Modeſty,</hi> and the like. And this Charge is ſet forth by a <hi>pompous Company</hi> of Great and Reverend Names, that in view of ſo much <hi>Reverence</hi> and Grandeur, our Diſreſpect may appear the more Notorious. It is pity that ſo much Art ſhould be ſo ill employ'd. Are theſe terms of <hi>Inſincerity, Diſingenuity,</hi> &amp;c. any thing elſe but the plain and ſimple (nay, the ſofteſt) Appellations of ſuch things as theſe Gentlemen are taxed with? Let them forbear to do, or prove they have not done, what they are unwilling ſhould be named, and all will be well. If they have any thing to ſay againſt thoſe Proofs wherewith we endeavor to make good our Accuſations, it will be to their purpoſe; but as long as they ſhall give us Occaſion for Complaints, they muſt be contented to receive them in ſuch Language as our Anceſtors have left us, 'till they themſelves ſhall teach us one that is more to their ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>And yet what are theſe Terms which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor complains of, in compariſon of thoſe which the Ancient Fathers beſtowed on the Separatiſts of their Time, and that meerly for Deſerting the Church, and without regard to any ſiniſter way they might take in particular to ſupport and juſtifie their Schiſm? To omit a multitude of Inſtances to this purpoſe, be pleaſed to hearken to St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>

O impudent ſaying! Is ſhe not, becauſe thou art not in her?—This moſt abominable and hateful ſaying, full of Preſumption and Falſhood, deſtitute of Truth, void of Wiſdom, inſipid, vain, raſh, precipitate, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, was foreſeen by the Spirit of God,</hi> &amp;c. Such, and much more, was the Language of theſe Holy men on ſuch occaſions. The Apoſtles themſelves, notwithſtanding that Meekneſs which they learnt from their Bleſſed Maſter, both by Precept and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, were no leſs liberal in this kind than others, as ſufficiently appears by all their Writings. St. <hi>Jude</hi> (to give you one Inſtance of theſe alſo) in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Epiſtle wherein he reprehends Railing, is ſo far from thinking ſeverity of Language towards Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics to be ſo, that his whole Work ſeems to be nothing elſe but (if I may ſo ſpeak) an <hi>Holy</hi> Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive againſt them. He calls them <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly Men,</hi> and compares them to <hi>Brute Beaſts:</hi> By and by he ſtiles them, <hi>Followers of</hi> Cain, Balaam, <hi>and</hi> Core; <hi>Spots, Clouds without Water, carried about of Wind, Trees without Fruit, twice dead and pluck'd up by the Roots; Raging Waves of the Sea, Wandring Stars, Mockers in the laſt time,</hi> with much more of this
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41662:68"/>
nature. And laſtly, that we may know whom he means by all this, he gives us their <hi>Mark</hi> and their <hi>Crime</hi> in one ſingle word: <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>be they who</hi> SEPARATE <hi>themſelves.</hi> This therefore being the Phraſe of the Apoſtles and Saints, <hi>(viz.</hi> ſo ſharp, ſo penetrating, ſo full of perfect abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) towards thoſe who violated, what they had ſo tender a concern for, the Unity of the Church; I ſhall need few words for the Juſtification of a ſharpneſs of Language, which comes far ſhort of theirs. For if bare Separation deſerv'd ſo much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, what ſhall we ſay when erroneous Doctrin is added to Separation, and both are maintained by unjuſt and fraudulent Proceedings? On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I am afraid it would be a harder task to excuſe that coldneſs wherewith we often treat ſuch things as theſe. It may very well be apprehended, that whil'ſt we play the Courtiers too much in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, we may leave the Crimes of Hereſie and Schiſm diveſted of that Horrour wherewith they ought always to be repreſented. And therefore, to ſay the truth, it was not ſo much for the defence of the ſeverity of our Language towards Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants that I have choſen theſe two Inſtances out of numberleſs others of the ſame time, and to the ſame purpoſe; but it was chiefly that I might take this occaſion of ſhewing my Readers what great apprehenſions the Primitive Chriſtians had of thoſe things whereof now-adays we make ſo little account, that ſo what the Age will not bear from my Pen, they may receive from thoſe whom they pretend to follow. <hi>There is but little difference</hi> (ſay ſome) <hi>between <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s and the Catholics;</hi> as if that were little for which the Unity of the Church
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41662:69"/>
is broken; or, indeed, as if the meer breach of that Unity were little. Let them who have this thought, conſider theſe two paſſages which I have cited, and for farther ſatisfaction (if they ſhall yet want it) compare on the ſame Subject the reſt of the Scriptures with the One, and the reſt of the Fathers with the other, and then it is probable they will be of another Opinion. I am ſure they will have reaſon to be ſo.</p>
               <p>I intimated, that the principal Deſign of my al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Examples of St. <hi>Jude</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> was not to defend the ſharp Language of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertiſts: This indeed had been ſuperfluous, and my Readers might well have blam'd me for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Paragraph. For beſides that what I ſaid at firſt of the neceſſity we are in of uſing ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions is abundantly ſufficient for their excuſe, we have the Example of our very Accuſers for the ſame ſharpneſs, ſhould we ſtand in need of any farther juſtification: For could but Dr. <hi>Teniſon conſider</hi> Himſelf and his Friends but half ſo narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he doth his Adverſaries, he would find that thoſe Reverend Gentlemen he mentions are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind-hand with us on that ſcore, but rather they give us two for one. What I have collected out of his own Pamphlet may ſerve for a ſmall Inſtance. There are other Books as well ſtor'd: But what need of more? It is well known, that <hi>Superſtitious, Idolatrous, Antichriſtian, Deviliſh, &amp;c.</hi> are Terms of courſe, and as ancient as that of <hi>Papiſts.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as the matter is now between us, if ſharpneſs were an undoubted ſign of an Apoſtolical Spirit, They would paſs for Apoſtles, and We for Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics. It is true there is a difference between
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41662:69"/>
ſharpneſs and ſcurrility, and therefore we ought to be careful that whil'ſt we imitate the Fathers in the One, we may not follow the Heretics in the Other; the One being the reſult of Zeal, the Other of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. And this laſt kind of Eloquence was heard ſo early amongſt our Reformers, (witneſs <hi>Luther</hi>'s eſpecial Talent in this way) that it may well be termed the <hi>Vagitus</hi> or <hi>Firſt-Cries</hi> of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>But, ſays the Doctor, <hi>They ſay this ill of us, not becauſe we are ſuch, but becauſe we are not theirs.</hi> This he SAYS, and becauſe <note n="*" place="margin">Ep. Ded. in his new Book.</note> 
                  <hi>Defending</hi> and <hi>Proving</hi> is ſo <hi>diſagreeable</hi> an Employment to him, he expects that his Pariſhioners (who <note n="*" place="margin">Ep. to his Pariſhioners in his firſt Book.</note> 
                  <hi>paſs as high Obligations on their Paſtor as man can have to man)</hi> will continue their <hi>high Obligations</hi> ſo far as to believe him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Proof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He tells them by and by, <hi>That</hi> J. S. <hi>is now under better hands.</hi> This looks like an Inſinuation, as if there were ſome hopes of reclaiming him. I thought the Boy had been paſt recovery. He was aſſured (as he ſays in the 3d page of his Narrative) that <hi>this Conference would be to no purpoſe as to the Boy.</hi> And ſince neither Dr. <hi>Hornec</hi>'s <hi>Things of Moment,</hi>

                  <hi>as it were) vaniſhes away,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon</hi> is left us in his ſtead.

Wherefore he now changes his Note. In his firſt Epiſtle to theſe Pariſhioners, he ſpoke thus: <hi>What I ſaid either with leſs</hi> Strength <hi>or more</hi> Warmth <hi>than I ought, I have ſet down, and laid it before your Charity. It may be I have a motive to ſevere Language towards</hi> that ſort <hi>of</hi> Men, <hi>which few have beſides me.</hi> Then he tells the Story of <hi>Gubbard,</hi> and concludes, <hi>This Inſtance of ſuch groſs Hypocriſie and Injuſtice made Impreſſion upon me when I was young, and ſo raiſed my</hi> Suſpicion <hi>and</hi> Indignation, <hi>that where I have met with any thing of a like nature, it has been ſome</hi> diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty <hi>to me to temper my ſelf: But nothing (I hope) ſhall ever ſo tranſport me, as to prevent the doing of my Duty among you,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had <note n="*" place="margin">Rem. Epiſt.

               <p>The Doctor does not deny, but <hi>in one ſenſe</hi> a man may hold <hi>Purgatory</hi> without being a <hi>Romaniſt: For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Bellarmin argues for a</hi> Purgatory <hi>out of the Poet</hi> Virgil. <hi>But</hi> (proceeds the Doctor) <hi>it was not certainly that</hi> Purgatory <hi>out of which men are relieved by Maſſes. And ſuch a</hi> Purgatory <hi>(notwithſtanding Mr.</hi> P.<hi>'s ſuggeſtion) Mr.</hi> Thorndyke <hi>could not hold, having forbidden his</hi> Nieces <hi>to</hi> Marry <hi>with any who ſhould go to</hi> Maſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>P.</hi> was no way inquiſitive what <hi>Purgatory</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndyke</hi> hold; it might be the Poet <hi>Virgil</hi>'s for ought he knew, (and ſo might <hi>Gubbards</hi> too for any thing the Doctor hath yet diſcovered) or he might hold none at all.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41662:72"/>
Mr. <hi>Thorndyke;</hi> either of theſe Points (foraſmuch at leaſt as concerns outward Profeſſion) being as <hi>Popish,</hi> that is, belonging as peculiarly to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholic Religion,</hi> as the other.

               <p>For which reaſon, altho' (according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctor's Suggeſtion) Mr. <hi>Thorndyke</hi>'s <hi>Ora pro Animâ</hi> ſhould not have been <hi>in</hi> Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi>'s <hi>way,</hi> it ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if it were; and therefore was as ſufficient for this ſurmiſe, as what the Doctor ſays of <hi>Gub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard.</hi> And what <hi>way</hi> ſoever this <hi>[Ora pro Animâ]</hi> was <hi>in,</hi> it was ſo far <hi>out</hi> of Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi>'s, that when he has put his beſt Conſtruction on it, he judges it a <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> and ſo far again out of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s, that tho' Mr. <hi>Thorndyke,</hi> as hath been ſaid, died in their Communion, yet (it ſeems) they permitted not his Executor to comply with the <hi>Earneſt Charge</hi> he lays on him by his Laſt <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>He</hi> [Mr. <hi>Thorndyke]</hi> ſays the Doctor, <hi>imitated ſome Chriſtians about the</hi> Fourth Age, <hi>who wiſhed</hi> Reſt <hi>to none but thoſe who, as they thought, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready enjoy'd it.

                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:41662:72"/>
And truly it had ſo in my Opinion too (for I muſt not always differ with the Doctor) if they wiſhed Reſt to none but thoſe whom they ſuppoſed to enjoy it already. For, would it not be a <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in Me, (or in any one elſe whom the Doctor ſhould take for a better Friend) to wiſh that Dr. <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon</hi> were poſſeſs'd of the two Pariſhes of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin's</hi> and St. <hi>James's.</hi> And if a man ſhould wiſh (tho' ever ſo heartily) that the Doctor had a great deal of Sincerity, I am afraid that he would take it for ſomewhat worſe than a Weakneſs, tho' at the ſame time the Party ſhould tell him, that he <hi>imitated</hi> ſome Chriſtians about the Fourth Age in wiſhing to Folks no more than what they believed they had already.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould the Doctor fancy thàt thoſe Holy and Learned Men, I mean the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, thoſe Pillars of Chriſtianity, during the firſt and pureſt Ages of the Church, and thoſe whom not only Mr. <hi>Thorndyke,</hi> but the whole Engliſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation pretends to <hi>imitate;</hi> why, I ſay, ſhould he imagin that theſe Great Men were guilty of ſo much <hi>Weakneſs?</hi> Certainly if Chriſtian Religion be a <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Theſe Fathers pray'd for the Dead in moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Terms; they offer'd Sacrifices for them; they begg'd of Almighty God to forgive them their ſins; they exhorted the Faithful to do the like; they declared that ſuch Prayers and Sacrifices were <hi>beneficial</hi> to the Souls of the Deceaſed.

aſſures us, this Practice of <hi>Praying for the Dead</hi> was Univerſal. By <hi>about the Fourth Age,</hi> I ſuppoſe he means the ſaid <hi>Fourth,</hi> and the two next to it both before and after, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Fifth</hi> and the <hi>Third;</hi> and to theſe he might, if he had ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, have added the Two Firſt. So that we have the ſettled Cuſtom of all Antiquity deliver'd to us as the peculiar or private Practice of <hi>ſome Chriſtians about the Fourth Age.</hi> Neither is this without Myſtery: For having ſaid in his firſt Book, <hi>p.</hi> 16. that he would not <hi>part</hi> with the Fathers, and having now an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of diſmiſſing them as <hi>weak</hi> men, he ſigns their Diſcharge in other Names, that he may not ſeem to be worſe than his word. When he can diſcover any thing in their Writings which may be wreſted for his purpoſe, they ſhall be as much <hi>Fathers</hi> as you pleaſe<hi>:</hi> but when he catches them holding a Popiſh Doctrin, they are out of Favor, and muſt be turn'd into <hi>ſome Chriſtians about the Fourth Age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the Doctor means, by what he ſays in this place, that there were ſome Chriſtians about the time he mentions, who imagined that Souls could not be help'd by Prayers or Wiſhes, and therefore wiſh'd Reſt to none but whom they ſuppoſed to enjoy what they wiſh'd them, and ſo diſſented from the Univerſal Church, which (as hath been ſhewn) pray'd for the Dead out of another Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple<hi>:</hi> There might, for ought I know, have been <hi>ſome</hi> ſuch Chriſtians, but as yet I never heard of them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if by <hi>ſome Chriſtians wiſhing Reſt to ſuch as they thought to have it,</hi> he means that they had ſo good an Opinion of thoſe they pray'd for, as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41662:74"/>
to <hi>think</hi> they were already received into Bliſs; he need not play the Antiquary ſo much as to go to the Fourth Age for ſuch Chriſtians as theſe: They may be found in the Seventeenth: We our ſelves [the Catholics of theſe times] are not ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, but that we <hi>think</hi> that many of our Deceaſed Brethren, whom we recommend to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God in our daily Prayers, are already in the fruition of that Glory which we ſo earneſtly ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite for them; but becauſe we do but <hi>think</hi> ſo, and are not certain of it, we ſtill continue our uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Interceſſions, left poſſibly it may not be ſo well with them as we imagin: And ſo our Charity is exerciſed both ways, as well by offereing this Relief to our Friends, as by having ſo good an Opinion of them at the ſame time as to <hi>think</hi> they need it not. And in this manner St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> pray'd for his Mother.

And ſo much for the Preface: I come now to what concerns me in the Book.</p>
               <p>I am told that Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> in the 58th page of his new Book calls me a <hi>Manager in Conference.</hi> And again, page 96. he ſays, <hi>That I am the very Sales-man at every Auction of Arguments.</hi> What the Doctor means by this, I cannot well tell, nor I ſuppoſe He himſelf. Poſſibly it was ſomewhat that came into his Head, whil'ſt the Pen was in his Hand, and down it went at all Adventures. For this was the ſecond Conference I was ever at in my Life, (excepting caſual and unſought Rencounters) and how unwillingly I came to this, I have already given my Readers an Account. It is true that I had like to have been at one or two more in Mr. G. 's Company, had not the Miniſters who were to be his Antagoniſts diſappointed him twice or thrice. But this was before Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had publiſhed his firſt Letter to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> and ſo given me to underſtand how great an Advantage Latitudinarian Wits have over one (not only much leſs, but alſo) ty'd within the ſtreight Rules of Sincerity. It is true, the Goodneſs of a Cauſe is of great Weight, but the Diſingenuity of an Adverſary is a ſhrewd Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe.</p>
               <p>Now, I ſay, how my Being at theſe two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences (and that accidentally too, and foraſmuch as concerns the latter, very unwillingly) could ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me that <hi>Manager,</hi> and <hi>Sales-man at Auctions of Arguments,</hi> which the Doctor's Nick-naming Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty would make me, I do not perceive.

                  <hi>fortitèr, aliquid adhaerebit,</hi> and therefore I ſhall ſay no more of it. [And yet it is hard to find out why the Doctor turns that into a Calumny, which fairly repreſented would be a Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For what could any man do better, who had a Talent proper for it, than employ his time in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Souls</hi> from Error; an Employment for which our Bleſſed Lord came into the World, and for which his Holy Apoſtles travelled through it? But I forget that the Retrenchment of <hi>Miſſions</hi> was one of the moſt conſiderable parts of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.]</p>
               <p>However, tho' I have not been at many of theſe Conferences, yet I will not deny but that I imagin my ſelf to have arrived to ſome competency of skill in them; and for ſome proof of this, and becauſe I deſire to be communicative in ſo precious a Talent, I purpoſe to make my Readers partakers of it, as a Reward of that Patience wherewith they have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto endured ſuch tedious and immethodical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, promiſing my ſelf, that for the ſake of this one Treaſure only, they will think the reſt of their time well beſtow'd.</p>
               <p>Now, foraſmuch as the worſe the Cauſe is, the greater skill is required in the <hi>Management</hi> of it, I will lay down ſome brief Rules, whereby, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, an ill Cauſe may be <hi>managed</hi> in Conference to the beſt advantage; and ſo as that the Defender of it (eſpecially if the Hearers be no wiſer than ſome of Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi>'s Pariſhioners) may come off with great Applauſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, let the Scene of your Conference be <note place="margin">Brief Rules how an ill Cauſe may be manag'd to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</note> lay'd amongſt your own Friends, and therefore, if the Diſputer be a Proteſtant (and ſuch he muſt be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41662:76"/>
to ſtand in any need of theſe Inſtructions) let it be in a Proteſtant Family. Before the Conference, and the arrival of your Antagoniſt, endeavor to poſſeſs your Favorers with a prejudice againſt him; propheſie ſomething which you are ſure will come to paſs, that when it doth ſo, they may have the better Opinion of you. For Example: Tell them that you are come alone, without ſo much as either Friend or Servant, [when you know that the whole Houſe are your <hi>Friends,</hi> and that none can be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to <hi>ſerve</hi> you than they are.] And then lay a wager that your Antagoniſt brings ſome one with him, [becauſe you think it imprudent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unlikely, that he ſhould truſt himſelf to the Reports of your Party, without ſome Witneſs of his own.] But this, as you ſhall word it, muſt argue Confidence in You, and Diffidence in Him. And when you ſhall ſee that he complies with what you thought Reaſonable, turn to your Company, and ſay, <hi>Did I not tell you that he would not come alone?</hi> Be ſure to begin the Conference with that which hath nothing to do with it. Make many Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons [at the Company, the Perſons, or ſomewhat elſe] without hearkening to any Accomodations. Let the firſt hours of your Conference be ſpent in ſuch things as theſe, which your Adverſary never thought of, and conſequently is not provided for. This poſſibly may diſturb him ſo as that he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his Arguments, at leaſt it will deprive him of that time which would be neceſſary for the carrying them on. [If Writing be propoſed, let it be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as earneſtly (but as plauſibly too) as may be: but when it cannot be otherwiſe, let the whole Conference be taken up in preliminary and frivolous
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41662:76"/>
matters, or at leaſt artificially broken off before any material point be concluded. But in theſe Written Conferences there is little room for after-Miſrepreſentations, and conſequently little Credit to be obtained, and therefore what follows, for the moſt part, has relation only to ſuch as are purely Verbal.]</p>
               <p>But now, your firſt Cavils being once weather'd, (which by the by, muſt not be, ſo long as you can hinder it) and your Adverſary finding room to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Queſtion, have a care of returning any Anſwer to it immediately. No, ſuch precipitation would argue a great want of skill; and therefore be ſure to ſtart ſome new thing, offer ſome Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to your Adverſary, and urge him to ſolve it. And let all this be done as prolixly, and in as many words as your Invention can furniſh: And he is a poor Artiſt that is not able to keep his Adverſaries Queſtion out of ſight for one half hour at leaſt. By this means you may promiſe your ſelf one of theſe two Advantages, <hi>viz.</hi> That either your Adverſary, by anſwering your impertinent Objection, will be diverted from his Point, (and when he is once ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being ſo, you may deal with him as you pleaſe) or elſe by not anſwering it he will give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the Pariſhioners to think that you have puzzl'd him.</p>
               <p>When the Diverſion will hold no longer, and your Adverſary becomes ſo obſtinate and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that, maugre all the fine things you ſay to hinder it, he throws out his firſt Queſtion once more, and the Hearers at length ſeem to expect your Anſwer: Here it is that you muſt ſhew your Art. Let your Anſwer be tedious and intricate,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41662:77"/>
ſeeming <hi>much,</hi> but being <hi>little</hi> to the purpoſe. But when your Anſwer is once given, ſtay for no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: Suppoſe that none can be given; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as if this Queſtion were already become your prize, begin a new Matter; Raiſe ſome notable Objection (as you did before) and ask him what he ſays to it; Make uſe of ſome opprobrious Term; Out with ſome reflecting Tale: Perhaps his Paſſion will be mov'd, and he will think himſelf oblig'd in Honor to defend himſelf againſt theſe New Attacks, and ſo quit his former hold, and then the Day is your own. But if, contrary to your Opinion, his tenaciouſneſs ſhould ſtill continue, yet ſtill you have this advantage: He anſwers not your Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this diſgraces him with the Pariſhioners; and it is ſo long ſince you return'd an Anſwer to his Queſtion, that he knows not what it was, and therefore is forc'd to propoſe his Queſtion a-new. The people are nauſeated with this <hi>Crambe:</hi> You tell him that you have anſwer'd this long ago, and for proof you repeat your Anſwer, with ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Phraſe; and to avoid Reply, run aſide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and lead him ſuch another Dance through Cavils, Similitudes, and Tales, as you did before. You have here the whole Method of Diſputation, and you have nothing elſe to do, ſave only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat theſe Rounds ſo often 'till the day be gone, the Hearers grow weary, or your Antagoniſt loſe all hope of advancing one ſtep farther.</p>
               <p>There are ſome particular ſtrokes of Art which your own Mother-wit will be likely to ſuggeſt as occaſion ſhall be offered. When your Adverſary will not go from his firſt point, be ſure to complain <hi>that he will ſtick to nothing.</hi> Lay a great ſtreſs on
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:41662:77"/>
trivial things, and make no account of ſuch as are moſt material. Let the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> be not worth the naming, and let the Cauſe of both Churches depend upon a ſingle Quotation. Turn frequently from your Adverſary with an Appeal to the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. This wins their Affection, diſturbs your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, and (what ought to be your principal care) is of ſingular Uſe towards the conſumption of time. Place your ſelf between your Adverſary and his Friend, whom you muſt repreſent as his Second; and when the Argument preſſes too much on one ſide, turn to the other, and ſo <hi>vice verſâ:</hi> By which means you ſhift the Diſputation to and fro, as Boys do a live coal from one hand to the other, with ſuch quickneſs that neither is burnt. You may alſo brag, that you have Two Adverſaries, when in Truth you have not ſo much as <hi>One;</hi> for inſtead of <hi>adding</hi> them together to make <hi>Two,</hi> you <hi>ſubſtract</hi> them one from the other; and what remains?</p>
               <p>To theſe things may be added the Merriments of ſome Droll, the Applauſe of the Company on the one ſide, and their Rudeneſs on the other, and the like.</p>
               <p>When the Conference is ended, call a Council of War; take a View of the Field of Battel; reckon what <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See D.</hi> T.<hi>'s Narr.</hi> p. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Yellow Perukes, Plain Bands,</hi> and other Enſigns of the Enemy lie there, that ſo you may compute the Number of the Slain, and underſtand the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Victory: Indict a Triumph; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that a Falſe Story differs not in Language from a True one, and for the moſt part men believe as they are affected: And then it is your own fault if the Common Fame be not on your ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:41662:78"/>
You have here my whole skill in the <hi>Art of Wrangling;</hi> and it is ſo much, that I queſtion not but when I tell you that I learnt it all (in a manner) at one Leſſon, you will conclude either that I am a very apt Scholar, or elſe that I had an excellent Maſter: And for my own part, if this will not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port an <hi>ill Cauſe,</hi> I know not what will.</p>
               <p>In the laſt of the above-cited places the Doctor repreſents me as one <hi>who love to be engag'd;</hi> and tells me, <hi>that poſſibly ſome or other may oblige me in the Art of Wrangling; but, as for him, he hath Employment more worthy his time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſtrange that the Doctor having publicly aſpers'd me at the Conference, and ſince more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly poſted me up in Print under ſeveral Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Characters, beſides what (I hear) he hath been pleas'd to beſtow on me in his private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, ſhould after all look on it as an <hi>Irregular Appetite to Wrangling</hi> in me, that I ſhould publiſh any thing in my own Vindication. He might have remembred how his Friend Dr. <hi>St.</hi> made the Nation ring with Complaints, becauſe Mr. <hi>G.</hi>'s Amanuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis had caſually left out a few words in his Copy, which (for any thing they added to the Senſe) might have been as well <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See the Letter to Dr.</hi> E. S. <hi>pag.</hi> 18.</note> out, as in. Dr. <hi>St.</hi> may do this; but as for me, I muſt be contented to ſit down under the heavieſt Reproaches, on pain of being thought a <hi>Wrangler.</hi> And even in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> is the Aggreſſor, and yet Mr. <hi>M. loves to be engag'd.</hi> How high are ſome men carry'd in their own Conceits! They imagin that the whole World was made for them, that as for the reſt they may tread upon them at pleaſure, and if Theſe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41662:78"/>
turn again, (as they ſay <hi>a Worm will do)</hi> the Others are hugely affronted! God deliver us all from this Spirit, which is ſo diametrically oppoſite to that of a Chriſtian!</p>
               <p>And here (beſides what I have already ſaid to this purpoſe) I will aſſure the Doctor, That I am far from being a Lover of Controverſie. Had I Time, Health, and other Talents neceſſary for Writing, I ſhould much more willingly employ them on Books of Devotion; and this becauſe I am perſuaded that with moſt men the Will ſtands in more need of being moved, than the Underſtanding of being convinced, at leaſt I believe that when the Firſt is done, the Laſt will ſoon follow. Such Converſions, as I have been more intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, have ever (as far as I could perceive) begun this way. And agreeably hereunto, our Savior generally lays the blame of Unbelief not on any Defect of the Underſtanding, but on the Vices of the Will: <note n="*" place="margin">John 3. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Light,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is come into the World, and men loved Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds were evil.</hi> And again, <hi>John</hi> 5. 44. (where particularly he notes <hi>Pride</hi> as a principal hindrance of Faith) <hi>How can you believe, who receive Honor one of another, and the Honor which is from God only you ſeek not?</hi> And foraſmuch as concerns even our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Heſitations in point of Faith, I queſtion not but they all proceed from the ſame Root. The Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Tranſubſtantiation, or ſome other Myſtery may be pretended, but the Real Hindrance is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe; <hi>ſome foreſeen Perſecution, or other Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inconvenience; the Diſpleaſure of Friends, the Cenſure of the World;</hi> (if not theſe, yet) <hi>the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeableneſs of Confeſſion and doing Penance, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:41662:79"/>
                  <hi>of ſome Reſtitution, or of breaking with ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Vice, the enjoyn'd Celibacy of a leading ſort of Men:</hi> Theſe things, I ſay, and ſome others of the like quality are (in their turns) the ordinary ſource of all our Repugnances againſt Religion. I do not mean that men are generally hindred by ſuch irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Paſſions from profeſſing what they believe, (tho' it may be feared that this alſo too often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens) but that they are hindred by them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving what they ought, and what (were it not for ſuch Byaſſes) they would.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, if the main (I might ſay only) Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle of true Faith be a perverſeneſs of Will, it follows that ſuch Books as tend to the warming of the Affection are more probable means of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, than ſuch as are directed for the enlightning of the Underſtanding<hi>:</hi> Not but that Books of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie are uſeful too in their ſeaſon, and thoſe who are qualified for this way of Writing do well in making us Partakers of their Labor, and indeed the Proceedings of our Adverſaries in a manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act it; but as for me, I am led by Judgment and Inclination to give the preference to Treatiſes of another kind. And therefore thoſe who have taken in that Character which the Doctor is pleaſed to give of me in this place, as if I loved Controverſie, are (if it imports them to know it) much deceived; this being an Art no leſs contrary to my Liking, than it is above my Capacity. But foraſmuch as concerns my preſent Task, I cannot but promiſe my ſelf that the Neceſſity that was put upon me will excuſe the Undertaking, and the Goodneſs of the Cauſe bring me through it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:41662:79"/>
The Doctor (if I miſtake him not) threatens to leave me <hi>engag'd</hi> with a new Antagoniſt. But why ſhould he, who thinks I do too much in taking notice of what himſelf writes, imagin that another Pen is able to engage me? He ſeems to think that I might have let Him alone without Diſgrace; and what then ſhould oblige me to Combat his Second? On the contrary, it is my opinion, that when ſuch Calumnies are firſt vented, ſomewhat is to be done to ſatisfie the Judicious: but afterwards, when Old Calumnies are defended by New, the beſt Refutation of them is Contempt. And therefore, unleſs the Doctor's Second come into the Field with better Weapons than his Principal hath done, I ſhall leave him an Enemy worthy ſuch a Champion, <hi>viz.</hi> his own Shadow.</p>
               <p>And here, tho' I cannot but think it a little hard that the Doctor ſhould begin the War, and then leave me engag'd with freſh Adverſaries, unleſs my Revenues were as well able to hire Auxiliaries as his own; yet I muſt acknowledge, that his excuſe for <hi>not Writing</hi> is ſo juſt, that I wonder how he could find any for <hi>Writing.</hi> One would think that two ſuch <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Above</hi> p. 17. &amp; ſequ.</note> Pariſhes ſhould find him work enough. And certainly, were it not for a ſingular Art of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cures into Sine-cures, I ſhould have heard as little from Dr. <hi>Teniſon,</hi> as he would have done from me without a Provocation.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> (as I am farther inform'd) having ſaid that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> accuſes him of anſwering nothing to a certain Query that had been put to him, <hi>viz. How the Church of</hi> England, <hi>granting her ſelf to be Fallible (and for ought ſhe knew in actual Error) could</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:41662:80"/>
                  <hi>be the Church built upon a</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Rock,</hi> &amp;c? hath the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words: <hi>It is much that I had nothing to ſay upon this Argument, when Mr.</hi> Meredith <hi>may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that upon the Objection as made by him, I gave him this Anſwer, to which he has not yet reply'd; That our Church was no more Fallible than any other in the World; That God's Providence would not ſuffer all to fail together; That we had a certain Rule, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means; That we were as infallibly ſure of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of Faith, as a man is of caſting up a Sum right, tho', by Miſattention, 'twas poſſible to commit a miſtake; And that our Church could prove, it had rightly computed. This was ſaid to him at the ſide of the Bed in the ſecond Room, about the cloſe of our Talk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is very poſſible that Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> might be readier with an Anſwer to a Query at one time than at another. No man (generally ſpeaking) is always equally preſent to himſelf; a Paſſion may ſometimes interpoſe, and darken the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and this eſpecially is not to be wondred at in One who has <hi>peculiar Motives to Indignation.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he might <hi>live</hi> and <hi>learn,</hi> and finding himſelf puzzl'd <hi>to day,</hi> he might ſtudy the point better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>to morrow;</hi> for which reaſons it is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but the Doctor might have ſaid nothing to his former Quaeriſt, and yet afterwards ſay <hi>ſomething</hi> to Me on the ſame Subject. There is no great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in all this. But that which is truly to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired is, that he ſhould take that which he ſaid to me for <hi>ſomething.</hi> For my part I do not remember what paſſed herein at the Conference with diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction enough to be able to relate it, wherefore I ſhall take it for granted that the Doctor gives us a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41662:80"/>
faithful Account of the whole Affair; neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is it ſo much for his advantage, that I ſhould ſuſpect a Fraud. What the Doctor ſays of my not replying, is likewiſe extremely probable: I told him at the beginning of the Conference, that I came not as a Diſputant, but an Hearer, and he treated me ever after (and even when he diſputed with me) accordingly, <hi>viz.</hi> as one who was to hear, and not to ſpeak. And in the preſent Caſe, whether it be probable that my ſilence proceeded from the want of a Reply, or of the Liberty of giving it, I ſhall freely leave my Readers to judge, after a ſhort Reflection on the Doctor's words.</p>
               <p>The Doctor (it ſeems) had been ask'd how the Church of <hi>England,</hi> granting her ſelf to be Fallible, could be the Church built upon a Rock, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> one that could not fail? To this he ſays, (and calls it an Anſwer) <hi>that their Church is no more</hi> Fallible <hi>than any other in the World.</hi> What trifling is here! The Quaeriſt ſuppoſes, that according to Scripture there muſt be an <hi>Infallible Church, (viz.</hi> as I have ſaid, one that cannot fail) and that the Church of <hi>England</hi> acknowledges her ſelf to be <hi>Fallible;</hi> and then concludes, by asking, <hi>How that, which by its own Confeſſion is</hi> Fallible, <hi>can pretend to be what is truly Infallible?</hi> The Anſwerer neither tells him (at leaſt plainly) whether there be any Infallible Church, or whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> deny, or own her ſelf to be Fallible, but anſwers like one who knew not what to ſay. <hi>The Church of England,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is no more</hi> Fallible <hi>than any other;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>She is no more Fallible</hi> than thoſe whom ſhe takes to be in Error. An excellent Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity! For whil'ſt he pretends that his Church is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:41662:81"/>
no more Fallible than others, he doth not deny it to be <hi>as Fallible as others.</hi> Wherefore the whole Diſcourſe amounts to this: <hi>Gentlemen, here are many Churches that have fallen into Error, and we have been ſo wiſe as to ſeparate from them on this account; and now (for our comfort) we are as</hi> Fallible <hi>as they, and for ought we know may be as much</hi> miſtaken. <hi>But</hi> (proceeds the Doctor) <hi>the Providence of Godwill not ſuffer</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>One would think however,</hi> that the Providence of God had ſuffer'd all <hi>Churches</hi> to ſail together, <hi>who ſhould conſider that the Reformers could find none amongſt them with which (if you will believe them) they could joyn with ſafe Conſciences, and ſo were forced to ſeparate from</hi> ALL. <hi>The common Anſwer is, That before the Reformation there were ſome Churches ſound in</hi> Neceſſaries <hi>of Faith; which,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient fulfilling of our Lord's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of</hi> being always with his Church. <hi>So then, it ſeems, we are aſſured by a Divine Promiſe, that at leaſt ſome Church or Churches were ſound in</hi> Neceſſaries <hi>before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: But that a Church</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from all others, <hi>ſhall be ſo, they do not, they cannot pretend that they have any Promiſe from God, nor other ſecurity than what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from a Banquerupt</hi> Enſurer, viz. <hi>their own Preſumption. And this certainly deſerves their moſt ſerious Conſideration. Members may fail without the Deſtruction of the Body.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>all to fail together.</hi> The place of Scripture alluded to by the Quaeriſt ſpeaks of <hi>one</hi> Church, whereas the Doctor talks of <hi>ſeveral.</hi> It is true, that this one Church to which this Promiſe of Infallibility is made, conſiſts of divers particular Churches as its Members, and that it is poſſible for any of theſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to <note n="*" place="margin">So far as ſuch</note> fail in Particular, but not for all of them together, and therefore if the Doctor had proved either that <hi>his</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was this whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Church here ſpoken of, or elſe ſhewn ſome ſuch whole Church whereof the Church of <hi>England</hi> was a Member, he had done his buſineſs. But whereas he does neither of theſe things, the Query conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſtill without an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:41662:81"/>
But becauſe what is defective in Strength may be ſupply'd by Number, (according to what I have ſaid <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 64.</note> above) out comes another Cypher. <hi>We have</hi> (ſays the Doctor) a certain <hi>Rule, and</hi> ſufficient <hi>Means.</hi> I ſuppoſe the meaning of this is, <hi>That the Scripture is certain,</hi> and I will add in the Name of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> That if we could hit on the right Senſe of it, we ſhould be ſo too: But becauſe we are <hi>uncertain</hi> whether we have this <hi>Right Senſe</hi> or not, notwithſtanding our <hi>certain</hi> Rule, we muſt continue <hi>uncertain;</hi> And then becauſe we have no <hi>means</hi> of knowing when we have this <hi>Right Senſe,</hi> and when we have it not, whatever our means are ſufficient for, they do not <hi>ſuffice</hi> for Certainty. Hitherto we have made but little progreſs; let us therefore make room for what comes next.</p>

                  <hi>We are</hi> (adds the Doctor) <hi>as</hi> infallibly <hi>ſure of the Neceſſaries of Faith, as a man is of caſting up a Sumright; tho', by Miſattention, 'twas poſſible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a miſtake.</hi> Not to ask the Doctor at preſent, By what Scales he weights the <note n="*" place="margin">I thought the Infallibility of a Church had been from God's Promiſe, and conſequently ſomewhat more than what is meerly natural.</note> Infallibility of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and finds it neither more nor leſs than a man has in <hi>caſting up a Sum:</hi> Is not what he ſays here alſo as much as to ſay, that they are as <hi>Infallible</hi> as a man that may be miſtaken, which was never (that I know of) deny'd to the Church of <hi>England?</hi> But here I take it for granted (tho' the expreſſion, as well as that which follows, ſeems to be ſomewhat doubtful) that the Dr. does not intend to ſay thus much, <hi>viz. That tho' indeed His Church might be</hi> miſtaken <hi>in caſting up its Sum, were it guilty of</hi> Miſattention, <hi>yet now being aſſured that it is guilty of none, it is impoſſible for it to</hi> miſtake. I ſuppoſe, I ſay, he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:41662:82"/>
does not mean this: For if there be no poſſibility of <hi>miſtaking</hi> in this Computation but by <hi>Miſattention,</hi> and the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſure that it has no <hi>Miſattention</hi> when it computes, it is ſure likewiſe that it is Infallible, becauſe it is ſure by being without <hi>Miſattention</hi> that it is without a poſſibility of miſtaking, which is contrary to the ſuppoſition of the Query, (which was not deny'd by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor) and to the Fallibility which this Church owns of her ſelf. The like muſt be ſaid of that which follows, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church of <hi>England can prove it hath</hi> rightly <hi>computed.</hi> For if a right Computation be liable to no miſtake, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> can prove that it hath this right Computation, it proves at the ſame time that it is liable to no miſtake, and therefore Infallible. In a word, if what the Doctor ſays imports that his Church is Infallible, I ſay, it is contrary to our ſuppoſition (not deny'd by him) and to her own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and if he underſtands leſs than that, the Query remains, <hi>viz. How that which is</hi> leſs <hi>than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, can be that which</hi> cannot <hi>fail?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet how frivolous and unſatisfactory ſoever theſe laſt Poſitions are, I cannot but applaud the Contrivance of them: For could any thing be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calculated for a Vulgar Capacity? <hi>How!</hi> ſays a <hi>Long-Acre-Artiſan, am I as ſure that the Proteſtant Religion is true, as I am that I have caſt up a Sum right? Why then I am ſafe enough: I have caſt up many a</hi> Bill, <hi>and have never been</hi> miſtaken <hi>yet, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when I have taken care. And (it ſeems) this is done without that</hi> ſupernatural <hi>Infallibility which the Papiſts talk of: And therefore what need is there of it?</hi> This is a very pleaſing Deluſion with People who
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41662:82"/>
care for no more Security in Religion than what will barely ſuffice for the keeping their Conſciences in ſome tolerable Quiet; and the more it pleaſes them, the greater hazzard I ſhall run of their <hi>ill will</hi> by endeavouring to lay it open. However, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am more intent on doing Benefits to them, than deſirous of receiving any from them, I will ſtate the matter aright, and by that means ſhew them truly how the Caſe ſtands. They ſuppoſe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with the Doctor, <hi>that the finding out of true Religion is like the</hi> caſting up of a Sum, <hi>and that</hi> Seekers <hi>in Faith are of the ſame quality with</hi> Accomptants <hi>in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetic.</hi> And now let them ſuppoſe with me, <hi>that twenty ſeveral</hi> Accomptants <hi>were employ'd about caſting up of the</hi> ſame <hi>Sum, and that the Life of each of theſe in particular depended on his</hi> right Computation; <hi>that theſe Accomptants were of</hi> equal <hi>capacity, and that in outward appearance they all uſed the</hi> ſame <hi>diligence and application; and laſtly, when their reſpective Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were finiſhed, that their</hi> Totals <hi>were wholly</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>one from the other.</hi> We will now ſuppoſe that the honeſt Artiſan, whom I mention above, is one of theſe Accomptants: <hi>What do you think? would he hold his Life ſecure, whil'ſt he differed in his Computation from Nineteen others, who had every way as</hi> ſufficient means <hi>of being in the</hi> right <hi>as himſelf?</hi> The Application is eaſie: There are Twenty ſeveral Computers in Religion (I might ſay many Twenties) of equal Skill and <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>I ſay of</hi> equal Induſtry, <hi>that I may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe moſt advantageouſly for the Proteſtants. For in truth it cannot be allowed that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in Religion is equal to ours: Witneſs our Laborious and Dangerous Miſſions, Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Retirements, the general obligation of Confeſſion and doing Penance, with much more which the Proteſtants have diſcarded.</hi>
                  </note> Induſtry; Salvation depends on their being in the right; They all differ in their Computations; The Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:41662:83"/>
is one of theſe Computers, and it is Nineteen to One that ſhe is in the wrong; and this is all her Security. Let the <hi>L. A.</hi> Trades-men conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would <hi>truſt</hi> Five Pounds on the like. And yet what is That (or indeed their whole Worldly Intereſt) compared to HEAVEN!</p>
               <p>And now what is become of this Famous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which wanted a <hi>Reply?</hi> Was it not truly Froth, which looks like ſomething, but vaniſhes whil'ſt it is look'd on? Theſe Gentlemen deal with their Clients, as Nurſes do with little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; bid them hold faſt, when they put nothing into their hands; and the poor Infants are ſo long deceived, 'till their Curioſity, (or ſome other Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite) prevails with them to pry into their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

               <head>THE CLOSE.</head>
               <p>I Have now run through all thoſe parts of both Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi>'s Pamphlets which I have thought fitting. I am not conſcious to my ſelf of any thing wherein I have dealt unjuſtly by him, ſave only (it may be) in the want of that <hi>Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> wherewith he <note n="*" place="margin">See his Epiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ded. to his new Book.</note> threatens to <hi>do Juſtice</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. <hi>P.</hi> Which piece of <hi>Juſtice</hi> if I have been defective in hitherto, I ſhall be a more careful Obſerver of it for the future. Only thus much I judged convenient to be ſaid, that when I ſhall think it reaſonable to ſay leſs, the World may not be miſtaken in the Cauſe of my Silence. A mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Defence (according to what I have ſaid above) is due to Truth; but when Calumnies
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:41662:84"/>
grow exceſſive, they anſwer themſelves by appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they are.</p>
               <p>It may be objected, That in ſome places of this rambling Diſcourſe, I deliver my ſenſe ſomewhat more largely than I did at the Conference it ſelf, whereas at firſt I ſeemed to blame ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. What I blamed was, that thoſe who have full Liberty in any Conference of ſpeaking what, and as much as they pleaſe, (eſpecially by way of Argument) ſhould afterwards, when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give Account of it, render their own Speeches more full and plauſible than they were, and yet repreſent them as truly ſpoken. This, I ſay, is what I blamed: But on the other ſide, when either a man is wholly hindred from Anſwering, or elſe cut ſhort in his Anſwers by the Authority or Rudeneſs of his Adverſary, and when by that means moſt of what he has to ſay remains in <hi>petto;</hi> it is but juſt he ſhould have that freedom in the Preſs, which was denied him at the Conference, provided that whatever is added on any Subject be related not as what was, but as what would have been ſaid, had an Opportunity been given. And this I have taken care of.</p>
               <p>I have already told my Readers after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Dr. <hi>Teniſon</hi> dealt with me at the Conference. He made his Applications to me as often and as fully as he thought fit, excepting only when I withdrew to avoid them: But as for me, I was to ſpeak no longer than he pleaſed, (I muſt confeſs a moſt effectual way of <hi>ſilencing)</hi> ſometimes not a word, ſometimes a few, but never ſo many as were needful. Neither is this the firſt time that I have made this Complaint: I did it at the Conference;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41662:85"/>
and particularly, the Doctor may remember, I told him there was no poſſibility of proſecuting any Argument, ſo long as he ſpoke all, and heard nothing. I added, that this indeed became a <hi>Doctor,</hi> but not a <hi>Diſputant:</hi> My meaning was, That it was proper for one who was <hi>Teaching,</hi> but not for one who was in the <hi>diſagreeable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Defending</hi> and <hi>Proving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But tho' the Doctor's Interruptions were remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough in all his Diſcourſes with me, yet they ſeemed to be more than ordinary a little before the concluſion of our Conference: For when I perceived that our Diſputations had no other viſible effect than the embittering of minds, and a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alienating of affections, I thought it not amiſs, before we took our leaves, to offer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might tend to the calming and re-ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of our Spirits, that ſo, tho' we came to no Agreement in our Religion, we might yet <hi>at leaſt</hi> part Friends and Well-wiſhers to one another. As ſoon as I opened my Mouth for this purpoſe, the Doctor immediately ſtopt it: Not a word muſt paſs. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>I am not going to Diſpute, but only to take my leave, and would offer a word that it may be amicably.</hi> No, it muſt not be; the Doctor is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable; and tho' I attempted it three or four times, it was impoſſible for me to get above three words over without an Interruption. Whether it were that the Doctor (out of his great propenſity to <note n="*" place="margin">Ep. to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. in his firſt Book.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuſpicion)</hi> ſuſpected that I would put an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him in diſguiſe, or for ſome other reaſon, I cannot yet tell: But I deſpaired of prevailing with him, and ſo gave over my importunity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:41662:85"/>
What I ſhould have ſaid (had it been allow'd me) was to this effect, That I could not perceive our Meeting had been to any great purpoſe; That I would not then diſpute on whoſe ſide the fault lay, much leſs who were in the right, and who in the wrong, as to Religion; That I deſired we might, notwithſtanding the difference of our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, live peaceably together; only at preſent I would intreat them to conſider, that whil'ſt they imagined the Catholics to be Miſtaken, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were but Men, and conſequently as liable to Error as their Neighbors; and therefore I would adviſe them in ſo important a Point as That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Eternal Salvation depended, that they would have recourſe to Almighty God, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſeech him, <hi>That if they were in the right, he would confirm them in it; but if in the wrong, that he would bring them to the right.</hi> This is all I would have ſaid, and this (upon the word of a Chriſtian) I was not permitted to ſay; which I think is ſufficient to ſhew of what nature the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Interruptions were.</p>
               <p>But what I had no leave to ſay at the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, I ſpeak here; and the liberty of doing it makes ſome amends for all that trouble I have had, and all thoſe pains I have taken on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: And could I be ſure that my Counſel would be followed, I ſhould deſire no farther Reward. Wherefore I earneſtly exhort my Proteſtant Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, That for an Eſtabliſhment in the true Faith they would make their chief Applications to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, whoſe <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Gift</hi> it is. Should I ſend them to Catholic Prieſts, their Prejudices might perhaps make them think it unreaſonable; ſhould
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41662:86"/>
I ſend them to their own Miniſters, they might ſuſpect a <hi>Gubbard,</hi> [or Papiſt in Maſquerade] and at beſt could hope but for a Fallible Director; ſhould I ſend them to the Scripture, what would it <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs by ſome plain Texts they are directed to an Infallible Interpreter, as indeed they might be.</note> profit them, ſo long as they carry with them their own Fallible Interpretation? Laſtly, ſhould I ſend them to Controverſial Treatiſes, they might complain of their tediouſneſs and intricacy: I ſay, ſhould I ſend them to any of theſe things, they might find ſomewhat to be afraid of. But what Apprehenſions can they have, when I ſend them to Almighty God? This is an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice wherein there can be no danger but in not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (my dear Country-men) I hope that you will neither hearken to the Suggeſtions of Pride on the one hand, as if you needed not God's Aſſiſtance; nor to thoſe of Sloth on the other, as if earneſt and perſevering Prayer were too dear a Purchaſe of it; but that fixing your Eye on that ETERNITY which lies at ſtake, you will deſpiſe whatſoever either by Flatteries or Threatnings ſhall ſtrive to divert you from ſo neceſſary an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. I do not ſay that other means are to be neglected, but I affirm that our chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Confidence is to be placed in This: And this is always to be put in practice, that our other Induſtries (whatſoever they be) may not prove ineffectual.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, when by following this Counſel you ſhall arrive at a ſolid and immovable Faith, as I queſtion not but you will, if you perſevere in your Pious Negotiation with ſuch Sincerity and Diligence as are requiſite to ſo Important a Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41662:86"/>
I beg of you that you would employ ſome of thoſe Prayers on My Behalf, which you have found ſo Beneficial to your ſelves, That as God has led me ever ſince my Converſion through many other kinds of Adverſities with Safety, ſo now he would vouchſafe to aſſiſt me under this new Load of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, which his Providence (always-Good) hath permitted to be laid upon me; giving me Grace to bear it as I ought, and to Thoſe who impoſe it, as much Felicity as I wiſh to my ſelf; and both to Them and Me (if it ſhall ſo pleaſe his Divine Goodneſs) a joyful Reconciliation on Earth, and an Eternal Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Heaven.</p>

               <head>THE POSTSCRIPT, In Anſwer to the Pamphlet put forth by the Schoolmaſter of <hi>Long-Acre.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS for the Schoolmaſter, (who has made my Name his Captive, and carried it, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in Triumph to the <hi>Paſtry-men</hi> long before now) I ſhall ſay as little to his Inſincerities in Print, as, he ſays, I did to his Arguments at the Conference: For tho' he has groſly Miſrepreſented me, yet at the ſame time he has given the World ſo juſt a Repreſentation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that his <hi>Miſrepreſentation</hi> is like to do me little harm.</p>
               <p>He ſeems to be a man (as far as may be gueſſed by his Work) ſo equally compoſed of <hi>Inſincerity</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> that it is hard to tell which Ingredient has the advantage; tho' for his ſake I am willing to give it to the latter.</p>
               <p>He repreſents me as one who ſeveral times interrupted Dr. <hi>T.</hi> in his Diſputation with Mr. <hi>P.</hi> A thing utterly falſe, and what Dr. <hi>T.</hi> himſelf (whoſe Charity has not greatly appeared in <hi>covering</hi> our Faults) never complain'd of. Nay, on the contrary, he confeſſes in his 6th page, That when Mr. <hi>T.</hi> had ask'd him a Queſtion, he turned from him before he would anſwer it, and expreſly apply'd himſelf to me.</p>
               <p>He uſes the ſame Ingenuity in the Account he gives of his two Diſcourſes with me conerning <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Confeſſion;</hi> which I ſhall endeavor to ſet right as briefly as I can.</p>
               <p>The firſt of <hi>Images</hi> paſſed in this manner: He had brought ſeveral of the common Sophiſtries againſt the Uſe and Veneration of Holy <hi>Images,</hi> and receiv'd Anſwers to them all. At length he urges, <hi>That it would be a Diſhonor to</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:41662:87"/>
                  <hi>God, who is Infinite, to be repreſented by an Image, which is Finite.</hi> I replied, That his Argument was ſtark naught; for by the ſame Reaſon we ought not ſo much as to <hi>think</hi> of Almighty God, for we being <hi>Finite</hi> our ſelves, and all our Faculties, we could make no other Repreſentation of him in our Thoughts but what was <hi>Finite. Ay but,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the nearer we come to the Nature of God, the better. That,</hi> I told him, brought on a new Queſtion, <hi>[viz.</hi> Whether the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting of God by an <hi>Image</hi> were remoter from his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than ſuch other Repreſentations as are uſed?] but as for what he then affirmed <hi>(viz.</hi> That God being Infinite, ought not to be repreſented by any thing that was Finite) he might perceive that it was altogether falſe. My inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to let him ſee the Error of one Notion, before I proceeded to undeceive him in another; ſince otherwiſe our Diſputation would ſerve for no other purpoſe than making a noiſe. I cannot tell whether the Schoolmaſter underſtood what I meant by this Anſwer, or not; but he replied no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>He ſeemed to me by his Behavior to be very ſelf-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore I took it for granted that it would be in vain to endeavor the convincing him by Argument, unleſs I could firſt perſuade him that it was <hi>poſſible</hi> for thoſe lofty Imaginations of his to be deceived. But becauſe I concluded he had too good an Opinion of his own abilities to humble himſelf before Men, I counſelled him to do it in the Preſence of God, conſidering that (whatever he might fancy) he was really no better than his Fellow-Creatures; and if he thought others <hi>Miſtaken,</hi> he might, for ought he knew, be ſo himſelf. I added ſomewhat more of the ſame nature, much according to that which (as I ſay above) I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to have ſpoken at my parting with Dr. <hi>Teniſon.</hi> He ſeem'd to be well pleaſed with what I ſaid, and thanking me for it (as he ſays himſelf) went his way.</p>
               <p>Whereas had he returned with his laſt Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Images, (viz.</hi> That we ought to come as near as may be to the Nature of God in our Repreſentations of him) <hi>That</hi> alſo might have been anſwered as eaſily as any of the reſt: For tho' it may be granted that our Thoughts

are immaterial, and therefore more proportionable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of an immaterial Being, yet when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate our Thoughts, <hi>(viz.</hi> theſe Mental Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) to Others, we are forced to make uſe of Material things: Of Air, when we ſpeak; of Ink, or the like Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when we write; of Wood, Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when Letters are carved or engraven; Laſtly, of the ſame Materials, when we ſignifie theſe Thoughts by Holy Signs or Images. Now, ſince all theſe ways of Repreſenting conſiſt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things, it cannot be ſaid that one of them comes nearer to the Divine Nature than another. Neither indeed is it of any importance which way the Repreſentation be made, provided that <hi>which way ſoever it be made,</hi> the <note n="*" place="margin">Viz. <hi>That which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Mind.</hi>
                  </note> Repreſentation be ſtill the ſame; and therefore when an Holy Sign or Image brings into my mind the ſame Thoughts concerning God which are brought by Words ſpoken or Written, that Repreſentation by an Image cannot be ſaid to be farther from his Nature, than this by Words; the Repreſentation (or that which is conveyed to the Mind) from both being perfectly the ſame. And therefore, when that Symbolical Figure (uſed by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as well as Catholics) of a <hi>Triangle</hi> awakens in me the ſame Notion which the word <hi>Trinity</hi> would do, how comes there to be a greater diſtance between the <hi>Figure</hi> and the Notion to which it correſponds, than there is between the ſame Notion and the <hi>Word;</hi> the one doing the ſame thing by the Eye, which the other does by the Ear?</p>
               <p>And if (as hath been ſaid) the Repreſentation by Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is the ſame with that by words, there is no more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Church ſhould deprive her ſelf of the Former, than of the Latter, eſpecially when ſhe may ſpeak to her Children by Images in thoſe places, <hi>(viz.</hi> in High-ways, Markets, private Houſes, and the like) where ſhe has no opportunity of doing it by Words, at leaſt to ſuch as cannot or have not the time or will to read Inſcriptions. And even in thoſe places which are ſet apart for Sermons or other Verbal Inſtructions or Exhortations, the Church hath no other way of perpetuating theſe Inſtructions and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41662:88"/>
Exhortations, but by Images, which are her conſtant <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The Doctrins of the Bleſſed</hi> Trinity, <hi>of the</hi> Incarnation, Life, <hi>and</hi> Paſſion <hi>of our Lord; as alſo the Conſideration of</hi> Death, Judgment, Hell, Heaven, <hi>&amp;c. being oftentimes brought to our minds as moving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Images, as by the moſt Eloquent Preachers.</hi>
                  </note> Preachers and Catechiſts, and ſpeak as often as they are look'd upon. Wherefore, to conclude, ſince Thought is the root of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the removal of things ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the inſpiring us with good Thoughts can be eſteem'd no other than a Stratagem of the Devil, who is ſure of keeping Goodneſs from our Works, ſo long as he can keep it from our Minds. And if we conſider what kind of Pictures have ſucceeded to theſe Pious Ones in many Cabinets, we ſhall have little cauſe to doubt on whoſe inſtigation the firſt Poſſeſſors were diſplaced.</p>
               <p>It may be objected, That foraſmuch as concerns Symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Figures, or any Repreſentation of God by an Image, it is probable they will miſguide the leſs-knowing, by making them think that God is ſuch in Shape, or ſome other Finite Quality as they find in the Picture. To which I anſwer, That there is no more danger of this, than there is that the ſame Perſons ſhould be miſguided by reading thoſe places of Holy Writ where God is repreſented as having <hi>Eyes, Hands, Feet,</hi> and the like. The Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter perhaps will tell me, That ſuch Expreſſions as theſe are Metaphorical, and not Literal; and that the common People are taught to underſtand them ſo: And he muſt give me leave to tell him in return, That they have a like Leſſon with us in reſpect of the forementioned Images, and the ſame care that prevents their miſtaking in one Caſe, will do it in the other.</p>
               <p>So much for the Schoolmaſter's firſt Diſcourſe. His ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was concerning the Secrecy of Confeſſion, and much of the ſame ſtrain with the former.</p>
               <p>He asked me, Whether if Treaſon ſhould be diſcovered to a Prieſt in Confeſſion, he were bound to reveal it? I told him, No; but on the contrary not to reveal it. I added, That tho' the ſecrecy of this Sacrament might ſeem at firſt ſight (and particularly in this Caſe) to be prejudicial to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41662:89"/>
the Commonwealth, yet in Truth it was not ſo at all, but rather very profitable. The firſt, becauſe the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth loſes no Diſcoveries by it; for were it not for this obligation of Secrecy, Traytors would own their Crimes no more to Prieſts, then they would do to other Men, <hi>that is,</hi> not at all, unleſs they intended to make a Diſcovery, or hoped to find a Fellow-Conſpirator. The ſecond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where there is ſuch Security of Confeſſion, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that ſome of theſe Criminals, either through ſome remorſe of Conſcience, or ſome imperfect deſire of difen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging themſelves, may diſcloſe their Conſpiracies to Prieſts, and thereby give them opportunities of dehorting them from ſuch Villanous Undertakings, of encouraging them to ſuch Diſcovery as ſhall be neceſſary for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Miſchief, by ſhewing them how they may do it with ſafety, and helping them in it, and laſtly, (when no ſuch Diſcovery can be obtained from their falſe Penitents) of doing all thoſe things towards the hindring of theſe evil Deſigns, which may be done without the violation of this Truſt. Theſe certainly are great Advantages, and ſuch as the Commonwealth would be deprived of, were it not for the ſecrecy of Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>The Schoolmaſter ſaid, <hi>That Traytors muſt needs receive great encouragement from ſuch Confeſſions towards the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Treaſon;</hi> which was ſo abſurd a Notion, that, I muſt confeſs, I took my Antagoniſt to be ſomewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound in his Intellectuals, and therefore thought it would be but loſs of time to have any farther diſcourſe with him. For what encouragement could he think it to be, for the going on in one Crime to commit another, unleſs this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſhould ſome way conduce towards the carrying on of the firſt? What comfort can a Traytor have by adding Sacrilege (as his approach to this Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Repentance</hi> would be) to his Treaſon? What new Incentives to Villany can ſuch a Miſcreant receive from thoſe Dehortations and Menaces which a good Prieſt ought to denounce againſt him on the part of Almighty God, if he perſiſt in his Wicked Undertaking? Laſtly, What an odd encouragement muſt it be in a Conſpiracy to diſcloſe it to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:41662:89"/>
one who (as the Conſpirators ought to think) will be ſure to hinder the Deſign, as far he ſhall be able to do it without diſcovering the Perſons? I do not ſay but this Sacrament may be abuſed as well as others; but I think that the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter has hit on one of the moſt fantaſtical ways of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it that ever could come into any man's Imagination. And yet, if any one ſhould have his Brain ſo ſtrangely tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as to receive an encouragement in his Treaſon by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing it, as the Schoolmaſter ſuppoſes; a good Inſtitution is not to be laid aſide, becauſe there is a Mad-man in the World.</p>
               <p>You have here a true ſtate of both my Diſcourſes with this famous Gentleman. How he has Miſrepreſented me in both. you may ſee, if you think it worth the while, by comparing my Relation with his: But for my part, I do not owe you ſo ill a turn, as that I ſhould tranſcribe ſo much of him as is neceſſary for it; eſpecially ſince it will be needful for me to trouble you with ſome fragments of his <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> by and by.</p>
               <p>So much for the Inſincere part of this Paper, <hi>viz.</hi> its <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations.</hi> I come now to the Ignorance of it, which is in ſo great a proportion, that, I confeſs, I have ſome ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for laying any part of the blame on <hi>Want of Sincerity,</hi> when the Ignorance, as it appears to me on ſecond thoughts, would have been ſufficient to have born the Whole.</p>
               <p>And in this point (according to what I intimated juſt now) I ſhall leave the Schoolmaſter to ſpeak for himſelf, ſince none can do it more to purpoſe. The good qualities of his Paper are conſpicuous enough without a Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and he that runs may read them. Only I ſhall add a few Notes, for the ſake of ſuch as (my Acquaintance with this Author convinces me) there are amongſt us. And <hi>we are Debtors</hi> (as I obſerved <note n="*" place="margin">

The Schoolmaſter ſpeaking, <hi>How Mr.</hi> P. <hi>had told him, That ſeeing God had appeared to</hi> Daniel <hi>in the ſhape of an Old Man, he might be pictur'd, ſo that we meant not to delineate him</hi> ſub Specie propriâ, hath theſe following words: <hi>To this</hi> A. C. <hi>anſwered, (which our Adverſary hath concealed) That as for the Text before us, what this Prophet ſaw, was only in a Viſion, which was a Repreſentation of God's coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fitted only to that particular Occaſion, and therefore ought not to be proſtituted to all Intents and Purpoſes whatſoever.</hi> Who ſays (I pray) that ſuch Repreſentations of Almighty God ought to be <hi>proſtituted</hi> to all Intents and Purpoſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever? Let the Schoolmaſter conſider for what <hi>Intents and Purpoſes</hi> this Viſion is recorded by the Holy Ghoſt, and why the Hiſtory of it is ſo often <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>The Hiſtory of this Viſion is permitted to be read by private perſons, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and for ſuch</hi> Intents <hi>&amp;</hi> Purpoſes <hi>as they pleaſe.</hi> Will the Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſay that it is <hi>proſtituted?</hi>
                  </note> read in our Churches, and then perhaps he will diſcern for what <hi>Intents and Purpoſes</hi> ſuch Repreſentations are uſed by Catholics. But, ſays our ſubtil Diſputant, <hi>That was a Repreſentation of God's coming to Judgment, and fitted only to that particular Occaſion.</hi> As if God might be repreſented as <hi>coming to Judgment,</hi> but not as governing the World, pardoning Sinners, or in any other Divine Action, and as if the Shape of an <hi>Old Man,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was repreſented by that Viſion, hath by Nature a greater relation to his <hi>coming to Judgment,</hi> than to any other of thoſe Works which I have mentioned. And this is the TREASURE which the Schoolmaſter complained that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had concealed from the World.</p>
               <p>He goes on; <hi>And then for the Lawfulneſs of Repreſenting God, provided it was not meant to do it</hi> ſub Specie propriâ, A. C. <hi>anſwers now, (he confeſſes he did not anſwer to this laſt part of the Objection at the Conference) Any one may ſee (if he will but take a little pains) the vanity of this diſtinction; for if God's Image be not given us</hi> ſub Specie propriâ, <hi>with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his own Eſſence, 'tis no more the Image of God, but the Sign of his Power which is repreſented in the above-mentioned Chapter of</hi> Daniel; <hi>His Throne was like the fiery flame,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But ſuppoſe all our Diſputant ſays were true, what comfort could it be to a poor Soul, who is charged with diſhonoring God,</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:41662:90"/>
                  <hi>who is Infinite, by repreſenting him by an Image that is Finite, and terminated by Viſible Dimenſions, to be told by Mr.</hi> P. <hi>That he does not diſhonor God, becauſe he hath no intention to repreſent him,</hi> ſub Specie propriâ? What think you, does this famous piece of Logic need a Comment? <hi>If God's Image,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be not given us</hi> ſub Specie propriâ, <hi>with relation to his own Eſſence, 'tis no more the Image of God, but the Sign of his Power, which is repreſented in the above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chapter of</hi> Daniel. Mighty ſubtil! If that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by Catholics, as God's Image not <hi>ſub Specie propriâ,</hi> be not God's Image, as the Gentleman ſays, why are we accuſed for making God's Image? But if it be, then the Gentleman is in the wrong. However it is to be underſtood that ſuch a Repreſentation is not God's Image properly, (for ſo much is meant by our ſaying that it is not <hi>ſub Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie propriâ)</hi> but Symbolically, or in the Nature of a Sign, as he himſelf ſpeaks, without underſtanding what he ſays.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Repreſentation in</hi> Daniel<hi>'s Viſion was a Sign of God's Power, and not of his Eſſence.</hi> A little above it was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of <hi>God's coming to Judgment;</hi> now, it ſeems, it is not of <hi>God's</hi> coming, but of his <hi>Power's</hi> coming. This will be ſine ſenſe by and by.</p>
               <p>Beſides, how comes God's <hi>Power</hi> to be more capable of being repreſented than his <hi>Eſſence?</hi> Are not both <hi>Infinite</hi> alike; and therefore what diſhonors the One, will it not be an equal diſreſpect to the Other? Wherefore if the Schoolmaſter allow that God's <hi>Power</hi> may be ſignified by an Image, he muſt not deny but that his <hi>Eſſence</hi> may. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is nothing <hi>in</hi> God but what <hi>is</hi> God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>Power</hi> and his <hi>Eſſence</hi> are the ſelf-ſame thing. Had our Diſputant's Divinity reach'd ſo far, it might eaſily be imagin'd that he would not have endeavored to evade this Inſtance of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Viſion</hi> by telling us that God's <hi>Power</hi> was repreſented there, but not his <hi>Eſſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſuppoſe,</hi> quoth he, <hi>all our Diſputant ſays were true, what comfort could it be to a poor Soul who is charged with diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring God, who is Infinite, by repreſenting him by an Image that is Finite, and terminated by Viſible Dimenſions, to be told</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:41662:91"/>
                  <hi>by Mr.</hi> P. <hi>that he does not diſhonor God, becauſe he hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to repreſent him</hi> ſub Specie propriâ? Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſays, It is lawful to repreſent God by an Image, provided it be not meant <hi>ſub Specie propriâ:</hi> Wherefore <hi>if all the</hi> School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter<hi>'s Diſputant ſays be true,</hi> what diſcomfort could it be to a <hi>poor Soul</hi> to do ſo? And why does the Schoolmaſter beg the Queſtion, by ſuppoſing (without proof) <hi>that a poor Soul will be charg'd with diſhonoring God, for repreſenting him by an Image?</hi> As for his <hi>Infinite</hi> and his <hi>Finite</hi> I have ſpoken to them already.</p>
               <p>A word or two more, and the Schoolmaſter ſhall hold his peace: For <hi>becauſe</hi> A. C. <hi>ſaid not this [viz.</hi> what is here repeated] <hi>at the Conference, he does intend to add but one word or two more. And</hi> firſt, <hi>That he might here obſerve, that if it were granted that we might picture each of the Three Perſons of the B. Trinity apart; That this could be no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all for its reſembling it (the Trinity) becauſe ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances do not only make Three Perſons, but Three Gods; ſuch Images as theſe repreſent not only a Diſtinction of Perſons, but a Diverſity of Subſtance. I leave our Jeſuit to think of this.</hi> I believe this Philoſopher is ſhrewdly puzzl'd when he looks on ſome of our Sheet-Almanacs<hi>:</hi> On his right hand he ſees an <hi>Old man with Wings,</hi> and on his left a <hi>Serpent biting his Tail.</hi> He is told that the firſt is a Symbol of Time, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of a Year. Now by deep Speculation he diſcerns that Time is a meer Accident, and that a Year is nothing elſe but ſuch a parcel of Time, and conſequently as much an Accident as the former, or rather the ſelf-ſame with it. Next he ponders how theſe two things <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>Old man</hi> and the <hi>Serpent)</hi> which are brought to ſignifie Time and a Year, do repreſent two living Creatures, and conſequently do not exhibit Accidents only (which is what they ought to do) but even Subſtances alſo, and this is to <hi>out-run the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable.</hi> To conclude, he either blames the Painters, (as I ſuppoſe) or knows not what to make of the buſineſs. <hi>I leave him to think of this;</hi> and I promiſe my ſelf that when he has ſound out the Myſtery, as alſo how the Appearances of Bodies repreſent Angels who have none, and how the Vertues, Vices, Death, Eternity, (where by the way he
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41662:91"/>
may note that an Infinite is repreſented by a Finite) and ſuch-like things are painted: when, I ſay, he has diſcover'd all this, I queſtion not but he will begin to underſtand how a <hi>Trinity of Perſons</hi> may be ſignified by a Figure without any neceſſity that ſuch Figure ſhould alſo ſignifie a <hi>Trinity of Subſtances.</hi> Such <hi>Signs</hi> as theſe, (tho' they have ſome Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in Nature) are of the quality of <hi>Words,</hi> and ſignifie juſt as men agree they ſhall.</p>
               <p>And now having diſſipated the Schoolmaſter's Sophiſtry, it will be an harder Task to defend my ſelf for having taken any notice of him. Indeed I had fully purpoſed to have left him in the quiet poſſeſſion of all that Glory he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>(at leaſt</hi> in fancy) by his Pamphlet; but eſpying the Name of my Lord Archbiſhop's Chaplain in his Title-page, I thought I could do no leſs than accept of him for an Enemy whom ſo great a Perſon had thought worthy of being a Champion. But what reſpect I have now paid to this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Name, I hope he will have for it himſelf for the future, and not prefix it where it is ſo little for his Credit; otherwiſe I ſhall think my Complement very ill beſtow'd, and have juſt occaſion of forbearing it another time.</p>

            <p>NOt having Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi>'s Works by me whil'ſt I penn'd what the Reader finds in my <hi>41th.</hi> page, I am afraid on ſecond thoughts, that the obſcurity wherewith Dr. <hi>T.</hi> quoted a paſſage out of that Author may have miſled me; ſo that whereas I imagined his meaning to be, <hi>That the Church of</hi> England <hi>was in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>before</hi> Luther, <hi>and ſtill continues in it;</hi> I begin to think be only means, <hi>That it was in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>before</hi> Luther, and nothing more. It matters not much which way ſoever he means.
